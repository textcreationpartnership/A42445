            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN every Age of the World we have any Account of left us, the Wickedneſs of Mankind has much the largeſt ſhare in their Hiſtory; and if we believed the Complaints of the ſeveral Hiſtorians who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with what paſſed in their days, we ſhould be diſpoſed to conclude, that thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular times we were reading of were certainly a great deal worſe than any that went before, and that conſequently Vice having been always growing and gathering Strength as the World advanced in Age, the preſent Generation of Men muſt far exceed all their Predeceſſors in Wickedneſs: but tho' I have a very ill Opinion of the Age we now live in, I cannot look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Reflexion as juſt and well-grounded.</p>
            <p>The true Occaſion both of the Obſervation and the Complaints grounded upon it, I take to be that variety of Wickedneſs whereby the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages and Countries of the World have been diſtinguiſh'd from one another. For there have been as many different Methods and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of ſinning among Men as Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:52063:4"/>and as many Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Vice as in Empire. Some Periods of Time have been remarkable for open Cruelty, Rapine, and Oppreſſion; others for Treachery, and private Revenge, and all the ſecret ways of Deſtruction; other Ages there have been, when Luxury and Riot, and all manner of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Luſt and Debauchery, were the publick reigning Vices; ſometimes Profaneneſs and a publick Contempt of Religion have prevail'd, at other times Indifference, and a careleſs Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of all that's good; ſometimes Hypocriſy and an open pretence to Piety and Vertue have been uſed for a Cover to a cloſe and ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all manner of Vice, and at other times Men have had the Impudence to defend the worſt Actions by endeavouring to make them appear conſiſtent with Religion.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many more ſuch like Differences, are obſervable in the Hiſtory of former times; but the peculiar diſtinguiſhing Character of this Age is a publick Denial of Religion, and all the Obligations of it, with an Endeavour to diſprove the Evidences brought for it, and to offer a more rational Scheme of Libertiniſm. 'Tis true indeed, this ought to be the Plea of all wicked Men that are reſolved to continue in their Vices, and upon that account it may be juſtly wonder'd at that the number of Atheiſts
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:52063:4"/>and profeſt Libertines has not been much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in former Ages than in this in which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to juſter Views and ſtronger Proofs of Religion than they had heretofore: But 'tis plain, there never were more than there are now to whom thoſe Characters do truly belong, whatever ſofter Names they are pleaſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves by; and the reaſon of it I look upon to be this:</p>
            <p>The Scriptures of the New Teſtament, which are generally in this part of the World believed to contain the Revelations of God, are ſo plain and particular, ſo full and expreſs in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they give of the Duties required of Men, and the future Rewards and Puniſhments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them, according as they obſerve or neglect theſe Duties; and the World is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned now by the great Improvements of Knowledge that have been lately made, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by a critical and exact Search into the Deſign and Meaning of the Sacred Writings, that 'tis impoſſible for Men of Senſe to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile a wicked debauch'd Life with thoſe Ideas of God and Religion they meet with in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and therefore they find themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, in defence of their Vices, which they cannot perſwade themſelves to part with, to deny, not only Revelation, but all manner of Religion too; ſince, if there be any Religion
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:52063:5"/>at all, they are forced to acknowledge the faireſt and moſt rational Draught of it ſeems to be laid in the Writings of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
            <p>This Method of reaſoning is now found to have a ſtronger Influence in quieting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and making a wicked Man ſatisfied with himſelf, than any Plea formerly uſed, becauſe it has a greater ſhew of Fairneſs and Sincerily in it; 'tis ſo very reaſonable and honourable a thing for a Man to act up to his Principles, that wicked Men are eaſily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to entertain a good Opinion of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Irreligion, becauſe the conſtant Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of their Practice to them makes their Character conſiſtent and all of a piece, and gives them a great Advantage both in point of Judgment and Honour over thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to other Principles, and yet act juſt as they do.</p>
            <p>But, whatever Preference may be due to theſe Men in a compariſon of them with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Profeſſors of Religion, and whatever Eaſe and Satisfaction it may afford them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Courſe of Vice that their Judgment and Practice agree together, I think it may be made very evident that they have only found out a new Artifice to deceive themſelves; and that all their Reaſonings are not only
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:52063:5"/>vain and groundleſs but directly oppoſite to the cleareſt Corruptions of Truth and Happineſs Mankind is capable of.</p>
            <p>This is the Deſign and the Pretence of the following Diſcourſe; and, to render it more effectual for the checking and putting ſome ſtop to the reigning Corruption of this Age, it is ſo contrived as to bear with equal Force againſt all the Principles that can be made uſe of to ſupport Irreligion.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that the Folly and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of downright Atheiſm are ſo manifeſt, and the pernicious Conſequences of no Religion at all ſo viſible in themſelves, and beſides have been ſo juſtly and largely expoſed already in many late Diſcourſes, that no body will dare to own the Title or Character of <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> whatever his private Sentiments may be; and therefore I have endeavoured to give ſuch a Proof of Religion as will overthrow all the looſe Principles and Objections now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of to evacuate the practical Force and Power of it; all which may properly be rank'd under the Style of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> if they will not be allowed to come under that of <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> which, as far as we are concern'd to know or do any thing in the World, I take to be much the ſame thing; as will be more fully made out in the Diſcourſe it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:52063:6"/>
            <p>The <hi>Being of a God</hi> is not indeed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly queſtion'd, becauſe the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of the Univerſe cannot be ſo eaſily and conveniently explained without ſome ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which the Name of God may be given; but, if what ſome Philoſophers vouchſafe to call by the Name of <hi>God</hi> be not an <hi>intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or be not <hi>Governour of the World,</hi> or does not <hi>More particularly concern himſelf with the Actions of Men;</hi> 'tis all one to us whether there be any ſuch Being as God or no; all Hypotheſes concerning the Origin, Duration, and preſent ſtate of the World are then alike, that is, they are all equally fit to entertain our Imaginations, and help us to be inſenſible of the Tediouſneſs of living; which, if thoſe notions of God that I have laid down are not true, is all the Buſineſs we have to do here.</p>
            <p>But ſtill it will be urged, that allowing that Notion of God which I have given, there are few, if any, that can properly be called <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> becauſe the generality at leaſt of thoſe who are commonly thought to deſerve that Name do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe a God of all thoſe Attributes I have aſcribed to him, and to acknowledge that Men are under ſome Obligations of Religion; but, if we examine all their Principles together and conſider the neceſſary Conſequences of them, they are by Title and Profeſſion only diſtinguiſh'd
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:52063:6"/>from <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and not by any real Difference in their Faith: For the Religion of theſe Men is nothing elſe but a few honeſt Principles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Juſtice, Friendſhip, and Society, which are wholly owing to their Complexion or Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not to their Belief of a God; and the practical Influence even of theſe commonly reaches no farther than that particular Set of Men whoſe Company or Intereſts they are moſt ingaged in, and is intirely bounded and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their preſent Eaſe, Advantage, or Reputation, and not by any Future Proſpects in another Life; and thoſe of them who ſeem to allow ſome <hi>Future State,</hi> when they come to explain themſelves, make it ſuch a one as Men need have very little regard for in this.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Principles which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of thoſe who have lately inſulted the Chriſtian Faith do really believe and act upon; this is the ſum both of their Faith and Practice, however they are pleaſed to magnify the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Perfection of <hi>natural Religion,</hi> and whatever regard they pretend to have for the clear and eaſy parts of the <hi>Chriſtian Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Religion</hi> therefore I would here be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean that whole Scheme of Humane Duties we find delivered in the Writings of the New Teſtament, as recommended and inforced by ſuch a future State as is there deſcribed;
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:52063:7"/>which may properly be call'd, with reſpect to the Author of it <hi>Chriſtian Morality.</hi> 'Tis in this Senſe and Extent of the Word that I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and 'tis plain, that the Arguments made uſe of for this purpoſe will fit no other Scheme but this, there being no other Draught or Model of Life to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that would be capable of producing ſuch a noble Scene of Happineſs as I have ſhewn would be the certain effect of an univerſal Practice of the Chriſtian Morality.</p>
            <p>I have not deſcended to a particular Defence of ſeveral Duties commonly inſiſted upon as Principles of natural Religion, the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and natural Obligation of which is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by ſome who are willing to lye under as few Reſtraints as they can: this I ſay is not done not only becauſe it was neceſſary to give a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Idea of Religion firſt, and a particular Examination of the ſeveral Parts of it was too long a Task to come within that compaſs of Writing I was confined to; but becauſe I am fully ſatisfyed 'tis a truer and ſhorter way of reaſoning to prove the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Revelation,</hi> and that being throughly proved, to ſubmit entirely to the Authority of it, and regulate all our falſe and imperfect Views of Religion by that moſt perfect plan which God
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:52063:7"/>himſelf has given of it in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>'Tis for the ſame Reaſon I have made no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiries into the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our <hi>Future State,</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of thoſe <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hereafter, nor have pretended to explain the ſeveral Difficulties that occur in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> becauſe a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and Satisfactory Account of theſe things can be had no other way than from Revelation: and in general 'tis a ſufficient Anſwer to all Objections that can be raiſed from hence, that there is a <hi>God;</hi> that there are Marks and Tokens of Wiſdom in the whole <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy and Courſe of the World;</hi> that <hi>Man is made and deſigned for Religion here while he lives, and for a future State after Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any of theſe Principles hold, they all hold; and no particular Difficulties that do not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently overthrow the whole Scheme, can have any force at all. If there be no future State there's no Religion; if there is no ſuch thing as Religion there is no ſuch thing as Wiſdom or Deſign in the Frame and Conſtitution of Man, and if the Appearances of Wiſdom here have no Reality under them, no other Parts of Nature can afford us greater, and conſequently, we can have no proof of ſuch a wiſe and intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:52063:8"/>as God. In this Proceſs of Reaſoning we argue upon a full and comprehenſive Knowledge of the Principles we argue from, becauſe, if there be no future Life after this, we know the utmoſt that can be known of the State and Condition of Man: But the ſeeming Inequalities of Providence in the Conduct of the Univerſe can be no Argument againſt any of the Principles before advanced; becauſe, while we have certain Tokens of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom remaining, no doubtful Appearances of the contrary will be ſufficient to overthrow them; and all thoſe muſt needs be ſo where we cannot carry our Obſervations to the fartheſt end of things in all the different Points of diſtance from us; which is the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>For except we were able to take a full and exact View of the whole Univerſe, and all the Relations which the ſeveral parts of it bear to one another, 'tis impoſſible for us to know that ſuch or ſuch a thing was ill contrived in it; except we were ſure there was no ſuch thing as a future State, we cannot condenm the preſent Courſe of Humane Affairs as une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual or fortuitous; and except we were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with all the Circumſtances of our Condition in another World, the juſt Proportion of future Rewards and Puniſhments to the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Life, and the exact Manner and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of God's dealing with us hereafter, we can
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:52063:8"/>never make it appear from Reaſon that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Account of God's future Appointments for us is contrary to the Rules of Juſtice or Wiſdom, and conſequently that our Expectation of a future State is vain, becauſe the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Repreſentation we can make of it, which is that we find in the New-Teſtament, is ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded.</p>
            <p>If therefore the <hi>General Proof of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereafter given</hi> will ſtand good, no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Difficulties either in the real Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Nature, or the arbitrary Schemes and Hypotheſes of Men ought to have any weight with us. The next and only thing we are to do afterwards is, to ſearch and examine into the Scriptures, and being convinc'd of their Truth, ſincerely endeavour to form all our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practice of Religion upon that moſt perfect Model of it there laid down.</p>

            <p>REligion has been ſo long in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, ſo powerful have been its Influences, and ſo univerſal its Authority, ſo nearly is Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind concern'd in all it promives or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52063:10"/>and ſuch mighty Conſequences attend the Truth or Falſhood of its Pretenſions, that I have often wonder'd how the Men of theſe latter days, who are at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the firſt Riſe of things, durſt diſpute a Title ſo well owned and atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Denial of which is ſo dangerous, and which, if it had at firſt been falſe, they have no poſſible means left of diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; whereas on the contrary, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of its Truth are ſtill in being, ſtill freſh, and in all their ſtrength of Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as I hope in ſome meaſure to make good in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible I am engaged in a Subject, which ſeveral great and learned Men have already, and ſome of them very lately, treated of, with the wiſeſt Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and juſteſt Reaſoning imaginable. But, beſides that Truth it ſelf is fruitful, and a Subject of this nature hardly ever to be exhauſted, the ſame Object may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of different Views, there may be new and more ſuitable ways of offering the ſame things to the Underſtanding, or old Arguments may be ſtrengthen'd and fenc'd in from the Objections that have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly rais'd againſt them by ſome additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Supports: or, if there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52063:10"/>of all this in what I have to ſay, it may be ſufficiently juſtified to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries I have to deal with, if the ſame things are repeated again to their Shame and Confuſion, who have hitherto found nothing to anſwer to them, and are yet in their Sins and Unbelief.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is not ſo much their Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which nothing but unpromis'd irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Grace can effect, as the ſecuring and confirming others in the Truth that I chiefly aim at; ſince the encreaſing and propagating a true ſenſe of Religion among Men is my principal Deſign, and not a learned Triumph over an Adverſary, I have ſuited my Method accordingly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have made Choice of ſuch a one which in the general Management is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, tho' in ſeveral parts of it, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall in with that of others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> is what I undertake to prove, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall conſider Religion all together in the full Latitude and Extent of the Notion, and ſhall not inſiſt wholly upon the Proof of a God as a <hi>firſt Cauſe, Mover,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Being,</hi> but ſo far only as the <hi>Exiſtence of God</hi> is included in the <hi>Idea of Religion,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52063:11"/>that in order to ſhew the <hi>neceſſary Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> betwixt the <hi>Being of God</hi> and the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Religion:</hi> But ſince theſe Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſult from the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> as well as the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, and from the <hi>Relation</hi> the <hi>one</hi> ſtands in to the <hi>other,</hi> I ſhall chiefly make Choice of ſuch Arguments, as, being taken from what we know of our ſelves, are beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us, and entertain'd with the leaſt Reſiſtance or Suſpicion.</p>
            <p>All nice and philoſophical Reaſonings I ſhall forbear, as much as I can; but, where the Nature of the Subject, or the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prejudices of the Perſons to be ſatisfied require a more ſpeculative and metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Proof of things, I ſhall chuſe out ſuch Arguments of this kind, as will give the Underſtanding the leaſt difficulty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and ſhall avoid all ſuch, which tho' convincing to ſome that are already well uſed to Speculation, may chance to be ſuſpected by others of too much Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo will probably, tho' very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, create in them a Diſguſt to all the reſt. And I ſhall all along take a due care to diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch Notions and Opinions as are abſolutely neceſſary to the <hi>Being of Religion,</hi> and thoſe others, which,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52063:11"/>tho' oftentimes uſed in the Defence of it, and earneſtly contended for, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy what they were brought to prove if they ſhould be falſe, nor ſo much as alter any thing in the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Obligations</hi> of Religion.</p>
            <p>Now in order to purſue my intended Method with the more Clearneſs, I think my ſelf obliged in this place to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what I mean by <hi>Religion;</hi> a right Notion of which being firſt laid down, 'twill afterwards more eaſily and plainly appear, whether there be any ſuch thing; and if there be, whether it is reaſonable or neceſſary for Mankind to be influenced by it.</p>
            <p>By Religion then, in general, I mean all that <hi>Worſhip, Service,</hi> or <hi>Obedience,</hi> we that call our ſelves <hi>Men</hi> are to pay to <hi>God;</hi> or whatever we are, in any reſpect, <hi>obliged</hi> to upon the Proſpect of his Favour, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Penalty of his Diſpleaſure in <hi>this</hi> or a <hi>future State.</hi> From whence 'tis plain, that in order to make it appear there is ſuch a thing as Religion, we muſt prove that there is a God, or ſome ſuperiour Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who can, and does <hi>oblige Man</hi> to live after ſuch a particular manner; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52063:12"/>that Man is capable of, and actually under ſuch an <hi>Obligation,</hi> the Performance or Neglect of which, will be attended with very different Conſequences, and thoſe ſufficient to determine him to act one way rather than another.</p>
            <p>But if a Man was deſirous of convincing ſuch Perſons as denied all this, where ſhould he firſt ſet out in his Proof? What Order ſhould he give his Thoughts? Where muſt he take his Riſe when he is to prove original Foundation-Truths? What Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will be powerful enough to prevail upon thoſe who love a Lye, and hate to be reform'd? How are they to be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who are ſtrongly fortified with their Prejudices, and have hardly left a Man that would attack them any Ground to ſtand upon? Such an unreaſonable Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the common Senſe of Mankind, is juſtly thought by the Wiſeſt Men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no other Confutation but that of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? However, ſince thoſe who are yet innocent or indifferent may be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thoſe who are juſt entring upon the ways of Irreligion may be farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd and confirm'd in them by more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> the ſame is to be done for the Security of thoſe as ſhould be applied
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52063:12"/>to the Conviction of theſe, if they were judged capable of being convinc'd; and therefore the Method to be uſed upon this Occaſion muſt be ſuch as will ſureſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Pretences of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> as well as give the eaſieſt Account and moſt undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proofs of <hi>Religion;</hi> that ſo the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made uſe of by the Perverters of Mankind may loſe all their Power and Force upon others, by loſing the Advantage of coming unanſwer'd.</p>
            <p>In order therefore to ſatisfy thoſe who have not quite renounc'd their Reaſon of the Truth of Religion according as I have before deſcribed and ſtated it, and the Falſhood of thoſe Grounds upon which it is oppoſed, I ſhall proceed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall give ſome Account of the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> and that <hi>Relation</hi> there is between them, ſo far as is neceſſary to eſtabliſh the Notion of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove that there <hi>is a God,</hi> or a Being of ſuch a Nature as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſed.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52063:13"/>
            <p>Thirdly, From the Knowledge I have ſhewn we have, or are capable of having, concerning the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> I ſhall deduce a poſitive and direct Proof of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall farther evince the Truth of <hi>Religion,</hi> from a <hi>Compariſon</hi> of it with <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and the neceſſary Conſequences ariſing from thence.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I ſhall conſider the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Pretences</hi> of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> what can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in Defence of it, and what are the uſual Pleas for it; and from thence ſhew the Abſurdity and Folly of their Principles and Actions who have no better Reaſons for what they Believe and Do, than thoſe upon Examination will be found to be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I ſhall make ſome Enquiries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> or the Reaſons that induce Men to take up ſuch Opinions.</p>
            <p>And conclude with a ſhort Explication of the different Notions of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Deiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52063:13"/>I. Firſt then, I am to give ſome Account of the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> and the <hi>Relation</hi> there is between them, ſo far as is neceſſary to eſtabliſh the Notion of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Knowledge of <hi>Religion,</hi> as of all other Things whatſoever, muſt begin from the Conſideration of our Selves. Now our <hi>Exiſtence</hi> being granted, the ſame Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that ſatisfies us of this, if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend to what paſſes within us, will farther inform us, that we are capable of <hi>Thinking, Perceiving,</hi> and <hi>Knowing;</hi> which Capacity is uſually ſtiled <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and that we have a Power of <hi>determining</hi> our ſelves <hi>to Think</hi> and <hi>not to Think,</hi> or Perceive and not Perceive certain Objects or Ideas, and <hi>to move</hi> and <hi>not to move</hi> certain parts of our Body, and by that means other contiguous Bodies; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Power of <hi>Acting</hi> and <hi>not Acting,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own <hi>Determination:</hi> that is, we can actually entertain a Thought, or diſmiſs it; cauſe a Motion, or hinder it, when we have ſo <hi>determin'd</hi> with our ſelves, and that barely by <hi>determining</hi> ſo to do: which general Power of determining our Selves, and executing our own Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52063:14"/>or Commands, is call'd the <hi>Will,</hi> and includes all that, is <hi>active</hi> within us. And upon further Reflexion we may find, that in ſeveral Inſtances we have an <hi>equal</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to determine our ſelves to Think or not to Think, to Move or not to Move, and in ſeveral Inſtances an <hi>equal</hi> Power to Act or not to Act according to ſuch Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but in ſeveral others we can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves but one way; and in ſome, where we can determine our ſelves either way, we can obey but one Determination: In the firſt Caſes we act with <hi>Liberty,</hi> in the latter we are under a <hi>Neceſſity:</hi> But all our Actions, in all the ſeveral Inſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, are ſtiled <hi>voluntary,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding immediately and effectually from our ſelves, only when the Acting or not Acting proceeds wholly from ſome extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Violence ſurmounting the Strength of our Bodies, which is properly call'd <hi>Force</hi> as diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> the Effects of which cannot truly be ſaid to be ours, but belong to thoſe Beings who employed that Force upon us.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain alſo from Experience, that we are capable of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> by which I mean all manner of agreeable and diſagreeable Sentiments, whether caus'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52063:14"/>by our ſelves, or occaſion'd by any thing without us; that theſe are the firſt and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Springs of <hi>Action</hi> which ſet all our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a-work, and give Riſe to all our Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, the obtaining the one and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the other being the whole Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul; and that there are ſome Things which we are naturally, by our very Frame and Make, pleas'd or diſpleas'd with, without being taught by one another to be ſo, and conſequently, that we deſire and do, are averſe from and forbear ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things in Compliance with theſe firſt original Sentiments: From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that there is ſomething antecedent to all manner of Action begun within our ſelves, which is the <hi>Reaſon of it,</hi> without which it had not been, which when taken away or ceaſing, the Action ceaſes too, and there follows a <hi>Reſt, Acquieſcence,</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> This <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> of Action is call'd an <hi>End;</hi> the Perception of which at a diſtance, or future, as ſuch as would be, all things conſider'd, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Mind when preſent, than any thing it feels now, is the Cauſe of all thoſe Actions which are look'd upon as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the Attainment of it. Now if this Repreſentation be true, and the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52063:15"/>proper and fit, a Man is ſaid to act <hi>wiſely,</hi> and for his true Intereſt and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but, when either of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions is wanting, he acts <hi>fooliſhly,</hi> and to his Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>But, ſince by the ſame Experience we are inform'd that we may, and often do, act fooliſhly, and to our own Prejudice, by leſſening or diſcontinuing our preſent Satisfaction, or bringing more Pain and Trouble upon our ſelves than we already feel; and that the only Cauſe of this, is the different Repreſentation of things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from what they are perceived to be when preſent, both in themſelves, and in their Conſequences and Dependances; we are from hence convinc'd that there is no other way of remedying this Evil, and preventing our being acceſſory to our own Miſery, but by rectifying our Perceptions of Things, which, being future, do not by immediate Impreſſions aſſure us that they really are what they appear to us to be. And, if we ſtrictly examine our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Matters, we ſhall find that what we now actually feel or perceive we cannot poſſibly imagine to be otherwiſe than as we feel or perceive; that is, we muſt be undeceivably conſcious of all our own <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52063:15"/>and <hi>Perceptions:</hi> But how we ſhall hereafter be <hi>affected,</hi> we can no otherwiſe know than by knowing the different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Things that are to <hi>affect</hi> or be <hi>affected,</hi> with the Connexion and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of one thing upon another, in order to promote or hinder the one's being ſo <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> by the other.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the Knowledge we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of in this kind, we are to conſider theſe farther Obſervations upon our ſelves: That there are ſome Ideas or Notions that appear with that Light and Clearneſs to our Underſtandings, that we immediately perceive them in all their Extent, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Agreement or Diſagreement betwixt them, and afterwards the Dependance or Independance of others upon them; to the Truth of which Appearances we cannot poſſibly deny our Aſſent: That there are ſome Propoſitions which do not appear with ſuch Evidence as to command our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but have more to incline us to believe them true than falſe; and this according to different degrees: That there are others that appear with equal Motives of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which hold us in Suſpence, and will hardly ſuffer us to determine either way: And a great many things we have no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52063:16"/>manner of Notions of at all, for the Truth or Falſhood of which, nothing at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us.</p>
            <p>But, beſides theſe general Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Appearance of things as <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, probable, doubtful,</hi> or <hi>exceeding our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Reach,</hi> we are moreover to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two other kinds of Difference; the one between the <hi>real Nature</hi> of Things and their <hi>Appearances</hi> to us, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Appearance of Things to us with reſpect to <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falſhood,</hi> and their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to us with reſpect to <hi>Action,</hi> and the Conſequences of it, <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi> As to the firſt of theſe Differences, we find that what we are once really <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of, always appears <hi>certain</hi> to us; and what cannot appear to us but as <hi>certain,</hi> we cannot poſſibly conceive ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in its own Nature: But what is in its own Nature <hi>certain,</hi> may appear <hi>doubtful</hi> to us at one time, and <hi>probable</hi> at another; and what we aſſent to as <hi>probable</hi> now, may afterwards command our Aſſent as <hi>certain;</hi> and there are things, which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' we are not <hi>certain</hi> of their Truth or Falſhood, we are <hi>ſure</hi> we know as much as we can of, by the ſtrength of our preſent Faculties. As to the other Difference in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52063:16"/>the Appearance of things, with reſpect to <hi>Action</hi> and its Conſequences, it often ſo happens, that where the Truth of a Thing ſeems doubtful to us, it plainly appears to be <hi>ſafer,</hi> and more to our preſent Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or affords a better Proſpect of future Happineſs to act one way than another: and abundance of Inſtances there are in which we find our ſelves under a <hi>Neceſſity of Acting</hi> one way or other where neither ſide appears certainly true, but one only probable, or both equally doubtful.</p>
            <p>This is all the Account of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which I thought neceſſary to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deſign of eſtabliſhing the Truth of Religion: And I perſwade my ſelf, I have ſaid nothing upon this Subject, which any Man, that fairly conſults himſelf, can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly call in queſtion. But, if any Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do lye againſt any part of what I have now laid down, they ſhall be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered before I make uſe of it as a Proof of any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>All Queſtions concerning the <hi>Origine</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> its <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>ſeparate Exiſtence,</hi> I have purpoſely waved, as things which do in a great meaſure lye out of the Reach of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon,</hi> and conſequently admit of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52063:17"/>no <hi>certain</hi> Proof from <hi>thence;</hi> are, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly handled, involved in great Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of Terms, and, which way ſoever explain'd, I think, as far as I have hitherto ſeen, make no manner of change, either as to the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> of Religion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soul be <hi>infuſed</hi> or <hi>derived, materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> or <hi>immaterial;</hi> whether it <hi>depends</hi> upon the <hi>Body</hi> in all its Actions, or ſometimes <hi>acts of it ſelf,</hi> is <hi>diſſolved with</hi> it, or <hi>exiſts after it,</hi> if what I ſaid before concerning our own Experience be true, it will be found that Religion has a very good bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to ſtand upon, without being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by any of theſe Opinions. But if the Soul came from <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> is of a <hi>different Nature</hi> from it, can <hi>Act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of it,</hi> and <hi>Exiſt after</hi> its Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as there are ſeveral very <hi>probable Reaſons,</hi> and a great deal of <hi>certain Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> for, then are there ſo many addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Arguments for the Truth of what may be ſufficiently prov'd without 'em, from plainer and more undeniable Principles; as I ſhall endeavour to make good in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The next Thing I am to do, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> or what that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52063:17"/>or Idea is to which I affix that Name: which in ſhort is this; An <hi>Eternal</hi> Being of all <hi>poſſible Perfections</hi> in himſelf, and from whom every thing elſe deriv'd its Being, and whatever belongs to it.</p>
            <p>But, to give a more particular Account of my Thoughts in this Matter, I conceive God to be <hi>One unchangeable</hi> Being, of an <hi>intelligent</hi> Nature, who <hi>always neceſſarily Exiſted</hi> of himſelf, who knows every thing that can be known, who can do every thing that is poſſible to be done, who does every thing he wills, and nothing but what he wills himſelf, who enjoys an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable State of the greateſt Happineſs that can be enjoy'd, who never wills or does any thing inconſiſtent with this State, who makes <hi>himſelf</hi> the ultimate end of all he does, and next to that the Good or Happineſs of all ſuch Beings as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it; which together with all other Beings, and every thing that belongs to them, were from him, and depend upon him for their Continuance; and laſtly, who brings about whatever he wills or deſigns by the fitteſt and moſt proper Means.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to me to be the eaſieſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God we are capable of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52063:18"/>and if it can be proved that there really is ſuch a Being as is here deſcrib'd, I think 'tis all that's neceſſary upon this Subject, with reſpect to what I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken: For whether we repreſent God to our Thoughts as a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſimple act,</hi> a <hi>ſpiritual Subſtance,</hi> or <hi>ſubtle Matter;</hi> as the <hi>whole maſs</hi> or <hi>Subſtance of the World</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all together, or as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>active Principle of it;</hi> as <hi>confined to the Heavens,</hi> or <hi>diffuſed through the whole extent of Being;</hi> as the <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Creator</hi> of all things, or as the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence they flowed; or conſider him under any other Idea our Reaſon or Imagination can frame; if we allow all the Characters of a Deity before mentioned, 'tis the ſame thing, as to Religion, which ſoever of theſe Opinions we embrace, as will hereafter appear: But, if any of them are urged to overthrow that Notion of a Deity I have given, the Proof of ſuch a Being to which that Notion belongs will be a full and ſufficient Anſwer to them.</p>
            <p>Now as to the <hi>Relation</hi> there is betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> we thus conceive; That God is our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Parent,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of our Being and Nature, and all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Capacities of it, and that we are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52063:18"/>his <hi>Creatures,</hi> the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of his Power, and the <hi>Workmanſhip</hi> of his Hands; that God is our <hi>Protector, Governor,</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> and we are his <hi>Dependants, Subjects,</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> that God is our <hi>Benefactor</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our Happineſs, and we <hi>obliged</hi> and <hi>indebted</hi> to him for whatever we enjoy. All which Relations do neceſſarily reſult from the Natures of the Being related, as will plainly appear upon a juſt Compariſon of them together, and will be farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted when we enter upon the particular Proofs of Religion.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing therefore that I have given a true Account of the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> which being taken from Experience, can admit of no other Proof, nor no greater Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the only thing remaining to be done, before I come to the main Argument I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, is to prove,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That <hi>there is a God,</hi> or a Being of ſuch a Nature as I have endeavour'd to repreſent; which is the ſecond Thing I undertook.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing of which Subject, that I may expreſs my Thoughts with the more
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52063:19"/>Clearneſs, give every Argument its due weight, and everywhere proportion my Building to my Foundation, I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Being of God under the different Degrees of <hi>Poſſible, Probable,</hi> and <hi>Certain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, As to the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of ſuch a Being, I cannot imagine any Man of ſuch an irregular Make of Underſtanding, as to apprehend that Deſcription I have given of a Deity to be <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>chimerical,</hi> or to have any <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> or <hi>Contradiction</hi> in it. I am ſure I have ſaid nothing but what I very well conceive my ſelf, and I think is as eaſily conceivable by any Body elſe; and I have uſed the plaineſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Expreſſions I could upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>But, farther to aſſiſt the Weakneſs of our Underſtandings in framing a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Conception of God, we will conſider the ſeveral Idea's of which this complex Notion is made, and ſee whether they will not ſuit very well together.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis plain to any Man that reflects upon the Ideas he has in his Mind, that he has a Notion of <hi>Time,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Periods</hi> of it, which he can place at what diſtance he pleaſes to meaſure the <hi>Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52063:19"/>of any thing by, but never at ſuch a diſtance by all the Addition his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is capable of, but that he can ſtill ſuppoſe ſome Being to exiſt both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after;</hi> which Being, before and after which he cannot conceive any Time or other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he calls <hi>Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, when we conſider the <hi>Variety of Beings</hi> in the World, with their ſeveral <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> we are not able to imagine or ſuppoſe ſuch a number of any of them that there cannot ſtill be a greater; and this <hi>poſſible Variety</hi> of Things never to be exhauſted is ſtiled <hi>Infinite.</hi> And if we can conceive ſuch an <hi>Infinity</hi> of <hi>Things poſſible,</hi> we can conceive a <hi>Power</hi> proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable that can produce whatever is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be produced, and a <hi>Knowledge</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that which can know whatever can be known, and that is whatever can <hi>be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is we conceive an <hi>eternal intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> Being of <hi>infinite Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we do very eaſily without ſuch Intenſneſs of Thought, and <hi>nice Abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as People are apt to imagine; for we find <hi>Infinity</hi> almoſt in every Thing: All our Studies and Enquiries lead us to this Notion.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the <hi>Extent</hi> or <hi>Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> we leſſen and magnify
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52063:20"/>them till we are loſt either way, and ſtill find our ſelves as far from any Bounds as when we firſt ſet out upon the Search: When we run our Thoughts over the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> of <hi>natural Bodies</hi> in the World, the more Differences we obſerve, the more we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend poſſible, each new Difference ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, affording an inconceivable Variety of Combinations with thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd before.</p>
            <p>'Tis the ſame thing if we contract our View, and keep within the Compaſs of <hi>one Kind</hi> or <hi>Diviſion</hi> of Bodies only, as <hi>Plants, Minerals,</hi> and the like, the farther we advance our Obſervations, the more ſtill do the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Sorts</hi> multiply upon us, and the <hi>poſſible</hi> Variety of more does proportionably encreaſe, till confounded with the growing Proſpect, we are content to admire what we tried in vain to reach.</p>
            <p>'Tis thus alſo in the <hi>intellectual Nature.</hi> The <hi>different Degrees</hi> of <hi>Knowledge, Power,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> we are conſcious of, do ſufficiently aſſure us, that we are capable of greater and greater ſtill; and, whatever Notion we can frame of our own State with reſpect to any of theſe Qualifications, from the utmoſt top of what we are arrived to, we can look farther ſtill, and conceive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52063:20"/>higher Advancements of each kind poſſible in our ſelves, in other Men, or at leaſt in other Beings of larger Capacities; and this in a continual Riſe, without any thing to <hi>terminate</hi> our View.</p>
            <p>From whence we are farther enabled to conceive, that God is <hi>infinitely happy</hi> as well as <hi>infinitely knowing</hi> and <hi>powerful;</hi> that is, that he enjoys all the Happineſs that can poſſibly be enjoyed by any Capacity of being.</p>
            <p>Having got thus far over the Notion of a <hi>Deity,</hi> I think, we may with leſs Difficulty conceive, that ſuch a Being as this did <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily exiſt of himſelf;</hi> that is, that an <hi>eternal Being</hi> had nothing <hi>before</hi> it to be the <hi>Canſe</hi> or <hi>Author</hi> of its <hi>Exiſtence;</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he is <hi>unchangeable</hi> or <hi>always the ſame;</hi> that is, that an <hi>eternal</hi> Being <hi>always is,</hi> and a Being of <hi>infinite Knowledge, Power,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> is <hi>always alike, knowing, powerful,</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi> The <hi>actual Production of all things,</hi> which are not God, <hi>from him,</hi> and their <hi>Dependance upon</hi> him for their Continuance, and all other Circumſtances of their being, are no hard Things to be conceived by thoſe that acknowledge he can do all things poſſible; and he that knows every thing that can be known,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52063:21"/>may as eaſily be ſuppoſed to effect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he deſigns by the fitteſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means, and that is to be <hi>infinitely wiſe:</hi> And what other <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> can we frame for an intelligent Being of infinite Happineſs to <hi>act</hi> upon, but <hi>his own free Pleaſure?</hi> And who can hinder the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty from doing what <hi>he will?</hi> But that the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of all ſuch Beings as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, ſo far as it is conſiſtent with his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to grant them the Enjoyment, ſhould be very agreeable to his <hi>Good Will</hi> and Pleaſure, we are not, I believe, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doubt.</p>
            <p>And this compleats the Account I have before given of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God in ſhort, and have now examined over again more particularly.</p>
            <p>From all which, I think, I may ſafely conclude, that the <hi>Idea</hi> we have form'd of a <hi>God</hi> is no <hi>Chimera</hi> or <hi>extravagant work of the Imagination,</hi> but a very <hi>poſſible conſiſtent Notion;</hi> and that thoſe who affirm there is ſome ſuch <hi>Being</hi> to which this <hi>Idea</hi> belongs, cannot be cenſured for vain incoherent Thinkers, who have put things together without any ground or warrant from Reaſon.</p>
            <p>How far the <hi>bare Conception</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> as that we have framed of God, or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52063:21"/>the <hi>meer Poſſibility</hi> of ſuch a Being, does, without the Aſſiſtance of other Principles, prove the <hi>Reality</hi> of his <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> I ſhall not here examine. The Arguments drawn from hence, tho' in themſelves perhaps <hi>certain,</hi> to ſeveral Perſons <hi>convincing,</hi> and not to be <hi>diſproved</hi> by any, do not fit eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Underſtanding, nor have that regular uniform Face of Truth which takes at firſt ſight as well as pleaſes after farther Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: only thus much I ſhall alledge in their Defence, that the greateſt and commoneſt Objection made againſt this kind of Proof is very ill grounded.</p>
            <p>For 'tis uſually urg'd, that Arguments drawn from the <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of a God, are of no force in this <hi>particular Caſe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not <hi>univerſally</hi> conclude. It cannot be ſaid that <hi>whatever</hi> is <hi>poſſible,</hi> or we have an <hi>Idea</hi> of, for that Reaſon <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> is, and therefore 'tis thought that the <hi>actual Exiſtence</hi> of a God does by no means follow from the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> or <hi>Conception</hi> of ſuch a Being; whereas the Concluſion may hold in this Caſe, and no other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: for <hi>Conception</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> and <hi>Poſſibility</hi> a <hi>Correſpondent Power;</hi> and a <hi>Power of Exiſting,</hi> when applied to ſuch a Being as God, muſt neceſſarily infer <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52063:22"/>Exiſtence;</hi> as might be farther made out if there was occaſion for it: but, becauſe the unuſual Niceneſs of the Proof may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably raiſe ſome Prejudice againſt it, I ſhall wave the Proſecution of it; and to cut off all Colour of Advantage from ſuch as are diſpoſed to cavil, I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with having ſhewn that 'tis <hi>very probable</hi> and <hi>conceivable,</hi> that there <hi>may be</hi> a <hi>God,</hi> and paſs on to the next Enquiry I am to make, whether it is not <hi>very probable</hi> that there <hi>is</hi> one.</p>
            <p>A <hi>common</hi> Argument for the Being of a God, (and 'tis never the worſe for being common) is the <hi>general Concurrence</hi> and <hi>Agreement of Mankind</hi> in the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great Truth. We will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Argument it ſelf in its full Strength, and then ſee what fairly follows from it.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what may be ſaid upon the firſt is this: That all Accounts and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>preſent</hi> State of the World, and all the Hiſtories of <hi>paſt</hi> Ages that are now extant do agree to aſſure us, that, ſince the firſt Memory of Things was preſerved till now, there was no period of Time, nor any Nation under the Sun, in which the Being of a God was not acknowledg'd and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52063:22"/>believed by a <hi>vaſt Generality</hi> of all that were <hi>then</hi> and <hi>there</hi> living.</p>
            <p>And farther, that not only the greateſt part of <hi>Mankind</hi> taken in groſs, nor the greateſt part of every <hi>Nation</hi> conſidered as a diſtinct Society of Men, were of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but the greateſt part of every <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Diviſion,</hi> as they ſtand diſtinguiſh'd by their different <hi>Opinions</hi> in other things, their different <hi>Capacities, Intereſts, Ways,</hi> and <hi>Manners of Thinking;</hi> as, the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Ignorant;</hi> thoſe that had examined the Point, and conſider'd the Reaſons for and againſt it; and thoſe who had only had it propoſed to them, without any proof either way but what was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd from the nature of the thing; the <hi>Mahometan</hi> and <hi>Idolater</hi> who add abſurd things to the Nature of God, as well as the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> who think more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtently of him; thoſe that hold the <hi>World to be Eternal,</hi> or made by <hi>Chance,</hi> as well as thoſe who look upon it as the <hi>Effect of Wiſdom;</hi> thoſe that explain the Works of Nature by <hi>Mechanical Powers,</hi> and thoſe that in their Account of the Syſtem of Things make uſe of <hi>Intelligences</hi> and <hi>abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Notions:</hi> not only the <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> and ſuch as expect any good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52063:23"/>or ill Conſequences ſhould attend their Belief of a God, but thoſe whoſe other Opinions declare they have nothing at all, or very little, to hope or fear from a God, as the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> the <hi>Sadducee,</hi> the <hi>Hobbiſt,</hi> and the <hi>Deiſt:</hi> and laſtly, all ſorts of <hi>wicked Men</hi> who are uneaſie under the Thoughts of a God, and endeavour to ſhake them off.</p>
            <p>Thoſe few that in different Ages of the World have oppoſed the common Belief, have had no Followers, and ſeveral of them at the Seaſons of greateſt Seriouſneſs and Recollection have renounc'd the Opinions they maintain'd at looſer hours: ſo <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</hi> has the Opinion of a God obtained among Men.</p>
            <p>From whence I think I may fairly infer thus much at leaſt, That ſuch a Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as this is very <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> and <hi>agrees</hi> very well with all the <hi>Principles of our Knowledge;</hi> and therefore, tho' it could not be <hi>certainly</hi> proved to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> from thoſe <hi>evident Perceptions</hi> we have of <hi>other Truths,</hi> yet being readily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by our Reaſon, without any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from them, it muſt upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only be <hi>extreamly probable</hi> and fit to be believed.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52063:23"/>
            <p>For ſuppoſe it to be an <hi>Error,</hi> what can we aſſign for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of ſuch an <hi>univerſal Error?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible indeed, that the <hi>Generality of Mankind</hi> may be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in a Judgment founded upon the Reports of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;</hi> they may believe that the Sun is very near of the ſame bulk in which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the Eye, when 'tis ſo many times bigger than the Earth; or, that it moves when it ſtands ſtill; or, if they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Wrong in either of theſe Points, there may be ſomething elſe of ſuch a Nature ſuppoſed, in which all Mankind may be miſtaken, as moſt of the Learned think the reſt of the World are in both theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But the <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence of a God</hi> are Matters of <hi>pure Thought</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> in the Conception of which, <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> have no ſhare; and therefore they can never owe their Original to <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Mind, by the Help of <hi>theſe Faculties,</hi> may make a great many <hi>falſe Repreſentations</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſion a great Variety of <hi>Errors</hi> concerning him; but it cannot be inferr'd from hence, that therefore <hi>thoſe Notions</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of a God in which <hi>all Men</hi> agree proceed from the ſame Fountain as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52063:24"/>
               <hi>theſe additional Errors</hi> do, in which <hi>they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> ſo very much, and that conſequently, in their own nature, <hi>thoſe</hi> may be as much Errors as <hi>theſe other</hi> are, tho' they are nor yet diſcovered to be ſo.</p>
            <p>The contrary, I think, is very plain: For the <hi>Difference</hi> of the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> in this latter Caſe proves an <hi>Incapacity</hi> in the <hi>Faculties</hi> to perceive the Objects they were employed about; whereas in the other Suppoſition, the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Perception is an Argument both of the <hi>Suitableneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the Matter perceived.</p>
            <p>There's nothing in the <hi>Idea</hi> of God, as I have endeavoured to deſcribe it, that falls under the Cognizance of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> nor is any Man conſcious to himſelf that he has perceiv'd God at any time <hi>this way;</hi> and therefore all <hi>ſenſible Ideas</hi> applied to him muſt be as wild and extravagant as the Ideas of blind Men concerning Colours, or at leaſt of thoſe of any other Men concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inhabitants of Planets and ethereal Regions, becauſe there is no manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance betwixt the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>one Faculty</hi> and thoſe of <hi>another,</hi> nor any diſcoverable betwixt a <hi>new Idea</hi> and thoſe we perceive <hi>already:</hi> ſo that if we ſhould endeavour to

            <p>Where-ever there is a <hi>general Agreement</hi> in the <hi>Perception,</hi> there is certainly an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> in the <hi>Appearance,</hi> which is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make an <hi>univerſal Error</hi> as an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Truth;</hi> and therefore, ſuppoſing all Men miſtaken about the <hi>Bulk</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> of the Sun, it neceſſarily follows from hence, that whatever <hi>appears</hi> to the <hi>Senſe</hi> in this Caſe <hi>appears</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> to <hi>all</hi> Men; ſo that the <hi>Errors</hi> occaſion'd by this means are not in the <hi>Senſe,</hi> but belong to <hi>another Faculty;</hi> nor are they either <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>invincible,</hi> not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe we need not have made any Judgment at all concerning theſe <hi>Appearances</hi> offered to our <hi>Senſe,</hi> ſeveral Requiſites to a <hi>juſt Senſation</hi> being want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without which, we know, we cannot judge with Aſſurance; not <hi>invincible,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Opinions concerning theſe things may be afterwards altered and corrected by <hi>Reaſon;</hi> which, being a Faculty ſuperior to <hi>Senſe,</hi> may preſerve us from the Illuſions of it.</p>
            <p>But when all Men agree in Matters of <hi>pure Reflexion</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> we have all the Aſſurance we can have, that they are in the <hi>right.</hi> For whence ſhould any <hi>Error pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed?</hi> 'Tis certain the <hi>Appearance</hi> muſt in this Suppoſition be <hi>uniform,</hi> and the <hi>Faculty</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52063:25"/>employed about its <hi>proper Object.</hi> Beſides, if there be a <hi>Clearneſs</hi> in the <hi>Appearance,</hi> the Underſtanding <hi>neceſſarily</hi> cloſes with it, and if in ſuch a caſe it ſhould be deceived, there is no <hi>higher Faculty</hi> to correct the Miſtake: How then can we imagine the Minds of Men to be ſo diſpoſed as to be under a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>being deceiv'd,</hi> as they muſt be if a <hi>conſtant univerſal Appearance</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould be only the Veil of <hi>Falſhood:</hi> For how can any Man help believing that to be true which always appears ſo to <hi>him,</hi> and concerning which he can receive no other Information from <hi>himſelf</hi> or <hi>any body elſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here perhaps it may be ſaid, where the <hi>Evidence</hi> is not ſo ſtrong as to <hi>command</hi> our <hi>Aſſent, Error</hi> may wear the Face of <hi>Truth,</hi> tho' we have not yet been able to diſcover the Cheat; and therefore 'tis our own Fault if we are deceived in <hi>this</hi> as well as in the <hi>other Inſtances</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> ſince we are not under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of giving our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the <hi>Appearance.</hi> To which I anſwer, that allowing a <hi>bare Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of <hi>erring</hi> in the preſent Caſe, all that I deſign'd to prove from this Argument of <hi>General Conſent</hi> holds good ſtill; which is, that becauſe all People have agreed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52063:26"/>a God, 'tis therefore <hi>very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> there ſhould be one, and <hi>very agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Reaſon of Mankind</hi> to believe ſo; ſo that altho' a Man is not from hence <hi>fully convinc'd</hi> of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it, he <hi>cannot help</hi> believing 'tis a <hi>very reaſonable</hi> Opinion, and that there's <hi>very great likelihood</hi> 'tis built upon <hi>ſure Foundations,</hi> tho' he has not yet ſearch'd ſo far as to diſcover them: For he cannot give an Account how all Men ſhould come to be miſtaken in a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Nature;</hi> and, if they were, how they could ever be undeceived: which may be done in all the Inſtances of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Imagination</hi> in which any <hi>Error</hi> can be judg'd <hi>poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that can be farther ſuppoſed to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance a Suſpicion, is, that poſſibly there was a time when Men believed <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> but ſome People having ſtarted ſuch an Opinion, and dreſt it up very plauſibly, it took mightily in the World, and ſo was handed down from one to the other, and in ſucceeding Generations ſpread and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, till it became <hi>univerſal.</hi> But there is no manner of ground for ſuch a <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, let us look as far back as we can, there are no <hi>Marks</hi> or <hi>Footſteps</hi> to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52063:26"/>be found of the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of this Opinion, no <hi>gradual Propagation</hi> of it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, it being in <hi>every Age</hi> we have any account of, as <hi>univerſally</hi> believed as it is <hi>now.</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>I do not know of any Opinion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that <hi>actually</hi> obtained ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> as that of a God, and afterwards was proved to be falſe; and 'tis very difficult to imagine how ſuch a thing ſhould come to paſs: however I can conceive and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be poſſible, that a miſtaken <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact</hi> or a <hi>conjectural Hypotheſis</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to <hi>natural Knowledge,</hi> may, at ſome diſtance of time from its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World, be pretty general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed as certain, and afterwards by a Diſcovery of <hi>freſh Circumſtances</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> or making <hi>new Obſervations</hi> about the <hi>other,</hi> a great part of Mankind may come to be of another Opinion, of the Truth of which they may be <hi>much ſurer:</hi> but theſe are things of a <hi>very different Nature</hi> from that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52063:27"/>we are diſcourſing upon, and an <hi>Error</hi> in <hi>either of theſe</hi> cannot prove the <hi>Poſſibility of a Miſtake</hi> in the <hi>Caſe in queſtion.</hi> For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that <hi>a diſtant matter of fact,</hi> and a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hypotheſis</hi> of ſomething out of the preſent Reach of our Senſes are hardly ever known to the greateſt part of Mankind taken <hi>in general,</hi> and therefore a <hi>general Belief</hi> of them can reſpect only the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> whereas the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> has in <hi>every Age</hi> been <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>expreſly</hi> believed by the <hi>generality</hi> of <hi>all ſorts</hi> of Men; beſides all this I ſay, the <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence of a God,</hi> being Matters of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion</hi> only, do not depend upon any ſuch <hi>particular Circumſtances</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> or other <hi>external Helps</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> as are the peculiar Privileges of a <hi>few,</hi> to whom the reſt of the World muſt be beholding for all they know concerning ſeveral Truths, as is plain in the Caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Obſervations of Senſe,</hi> upon which the Belief of a God is founded, lie open to <hi>every man,</hi> and are the <hi>ſame</hi> now they ever were; and the <hi>Inferences</hi> drawn from them are <hi>very eaſie,</hi> and within the reach of <hi>common Capacities.</hi> If ſome have refined upon them, and carried their Reaſonings
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52063:27"/>much farther than others, it has been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie the <hi>unwarrantable Scruples</hi> and <hi>Suſpicions</hi> of a <hi>few Pretenders to Learning,</hi> who make uſe of that <hi>little</hi> Knowledge they have to argue themſelves out of <hi>all.</hi> But the <hi>Generality</hi> of Mankind, both <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> have ſo <hi>firmly</hi> believed upon the <hi>firſt plain obvious</hi> grounds of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as not to require or ſtand in need of farther Satisfaction; and therefore their <hi>Faith</hi> cannot be owing to the <hi>plauſible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi> or <hi>ſpecious Reaſonings</hi> of any <hi>firſt Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of <hi>falſe Notions</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, after all, allowing the Suppoſition to be true, tho' I think it impoſſible that it ſhould, that there was <hi>a time</hi> in which God was <hi>no where</hi> acknowledged in the World; whoever <hi>invented</hi> the <hi>Notion,</hi> whatever were the <hi>Motives</hi> it was <hi>firſt</hi> invented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the <hi>Arguments</hi> upon which it was <hi>firſt</hi> believed, the <hi>Propagation</hi> of it <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Belief <hi>ever ſince,</hi> muſt be owing to the <hi>Agreeableneſs</hi> of ſuch an Opinion to the <hi>common Reaſon of Mankind,</hi> and all their other Knowledge, and to the Strength and Sufficiency of thoſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> upon which it is <hi>now,</hi> and has been <hi>ſo long</hi> received. For all the <hi>firſt Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> if they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52063:28"/>were any other than what we have now, and which have been the ſame in all Ages we have any Knowledge of left, have been all loſt, and conſequently their Influence ſpent, long ago; neither in any of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diſcourſes <hi>yet extant</hi> concerning the <hi>Being of a God,</hi> is there any Appeal made to <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Antiquity;</hi> as if Men were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe this Truth becauſe it was ſo antient, or becauſe ſuch and ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons had firſt recommended or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the Belief of it: But all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made uſe of are wholly built upon the <hi>Reaſon of the thing,</hi> which is always the ſame; the ſame plain Reaſons for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God have always had the ſame Influence, which, upon Examination, will be found to have no Art or Sophiſtry in them, and every body may examine them that will.</p>
            <p>Nothing then remains, but to enquire into the Force and Validity of thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which our <hi>Belief of a God</hi> is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally founded.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it now but a <hi>probable Perſwaſion,</hi> ariſing from that Readineſs and Aſſurance of Aſſent with which we embraced this Truth, and yielded to the <hi>firſt obvious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52063:28"/>Proofs</hi> of it, upon a bare Propoſal of them to the Underſtanding; in which Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are very much confirm'd by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>all Mankind</hi> have conſtantly agreed with us in it, being fully ſatisfied from hence, that no <hi>peculiar Temper of Mind</hi> or <hi>Scheme of Thoughts,</hi> no <hi>private Intereſt</hi> or <hi>national Byaſs,</hi> has diſpoſed us to make a wrong Judgment, but ſomething <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>whole humane Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all the ground the <hi>Generality of the World</hi> believe upon; and tho' to a nice Examiner of things it is not <hi>certain irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Conviction,</hi> yet 'tis ſufficient to juſtify a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>entire Aſſent,</hi> and to warrant our <hi>acting</hi> according to it. For to ſuſpect a thing to be falſe, and <hi>act</hi> as if it were ſo, upon a <hi>bare Poſſibility imaginable</hi> that it may be ſo; or rather, becauſe we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of Proof the thing is, in its own Nature, capable of, when, at the ſame time, we have no manner of Reaſon to diſtruſt what we have; can be neither <hi>rational, prudent,</hi> nor <hi>ſafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, Since there are Perſons whoſe <hi>Actions</hi> and at leaſt <hi>pretended Opinions</hi> come up to <hi>this Character,</hi> we will conſider the <hi>common Proofs</hi> of a Deity <hi>more cloſely</hi> and <hi>throughly,</hi> and ſee if what upon the firſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52063:29"/>View appears ſo <hi>probable,</hi> and makes ſo ſtrong an Impreſſion upon the Mind, may not, upon farther Examination, ſtrike us with that <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> that we cannot reſiſt, without queſtioning all our other Knowledge, and diſclaiming all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diſtinction betwixt Truth and Falſhood: which is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Third Conſideration I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in treating of this Argument: Whether it is not <hi>only</hi> a <hi>poſſible</hi> or <hi>probable Opinion</hi> that there ſhould be a God, but a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible Truth</hi> that there is one.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>common natural</hi> Arguments and Reaſons upon which the general Belief of a God is founded, are taken from the <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frame of things</hi> called the <hi>World,</hi> and thoſe ſeveral <hi>parts</hi> of it which fall under every man's Notice and Obſervation; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſlight Survey of which, any man that is in the leaſt capable of Reflexion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Thoughts light, will <hi>perceive</hi> or imagine that he perceives plain Marks and Tokens of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> much of the ſame kind, tho' in proportion far greater than he has obſerv'd in any of the moſt wonderful Effects of <hi>humane Skill</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52063:29"/>
               <hi>Strength;</hi> the immediate Reſult of which, I believe, would be this Concluſion, That certainly there is <hi>ſome Being,</hi> exceedingly <hi>more powerful</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> than <hi>Man,</hi> who was the <hi>Author and Contriver</hi> of this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Fabrick.</p>
            <p>And, if <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Curioſity</hi> invite him to farther Enquiries, as 'tis difficult to ſuppoſe they ſhould not, the <hi>Compaſs</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of the whole Work, the <hi>Variety</hi> of Objects in it, the <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> of ſome Appearances, and <hi>regular Changes</hi> and <hi>Revolutions</hi> of other, the <hi>Connexion</hi> and <hi>Dependence</hi> of the ſeveral parts, the <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Confederacy</hi> of multitudes of different kinds towards ſome common Production, and the <hi>various particular Ends</hi> and <hi>Uſes</hi> of things, all <hi>aſſiſtant</hi> to one another, and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient</hi> to ſome <hi>general Deſign;</hi> all theſe, I ſay, well conſider'd and weigh'd together, would ſtrengthen and confirm his former Judgments, and farther diſpoſe him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the <hi>Author</hi> of all theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Power is <hi>able</hi> to do whatever elſe can be conceived <hi>poſſible,</hi> nothing elſe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable ſeeming more difficult to this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than what he ſees already done; That a Being of ſo much Knowledge as his Works declare him, ſo vaſtly exceeding <hi>Man</hi>'s, is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52063:30"/>able to do Things which are far above <hi>Man</hi>'s Reach and Comprehenſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at all; And that he who has ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order'd and diſpoſed every thing he has made to ſuch proper Ends, has exerciſed his <hi>Power</hi> ſo far and no farther, becauſe it was moſt agreeable to his Wiſdom ſo to do.</p>
            <p>There's nothing, I think, in all this, but what is eaſie and natural, and what may very well be imagin'd to be found out without the help of much Learning or an extraordinary Talent of Reflexion; and yet this is what has conſtantly, in all Ages, ſatisfied both the <hi>Learned</hi> and the <hi>Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and ſtood the Teſt of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry,</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe <hi>ſome extravagant Thinkers,</hi> entirely under the Government of their <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Luſts,</hi> becauſe they were not by when the World was made, and do not ſee the Hand which ſupports the Frame, and moves all the ſeveral Wheels of it, ſhould therefore diſtruſt all their Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this kind, and doubt the Being of a God notwithſtanding the <hi>Teſtimony of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> is there no <hi>certain</hi> Proof to be given that <hi>They</hi> are not miſtaken who believe a God upon <hi>theſe</hi> Grounds? Several have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52063:30"/>already ſhewn there is, and this is what I ſhall at preſent endeavour to make good in the cleareſt and moſt unexceptionable manner I can.</p>
            <p>But, before I enter upon this Argument, I think it neceſſary to enquire what <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> is, that we may know what <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of Proof may be properly and truly called <hi>Certain,</hi> and what not.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Evidence</hi> (which I ſhall all along take in the ſame Senſe) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the <hi>Things</hi> or <hi>Ideas</hi> which are the Objects of our Underſtanding, is a <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Agreement</hi> or <hi>Diſagreement</hi> of one part of our Knowledge with another; as applied to the <hi>Mind,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Perception</hi> of ſuch Agreement or Diſagreement, or ſuch a <hi>firm well-grounded Aſſent</hi> as excludes not only all manner of <hi>doubt,</hi> but all <hi>conceivable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a Miſtake:</hi> And thus I ſuppoſe, and take it for granted, that we are <hi>certain</hi> of all our own <hi>Perceptions</hi> and <hi>Senſations,</hi> whatever we feel or are conſcious to our ſelves of; and that we are fully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivably aſſured of a great many of our <hi>Judgments</hi> founded upon the juſt and well-regulated Reports of our <hi>external Senſes,</hi> to the ſame <hi>degree</hi> as we are of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52063:31"/>and Diſagreement of any <hi>pure intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Except this be allowed, we have no <hi>Principles</hi> to reaſon from, nor indeed any <hi>Knowledge</hi> at all, not ſo much as <hi>Scepticiſm;</hi> but univerſal Darkneſs and Confuſion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver humane Nature: But he that grants thus much, and is true to his own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> muſt acknowledge <hi>there is a God;</hi> as will appear from the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Being then, as I ſuppoſe, by an <hi>infallible Conſciouſneſs,</hi> ſatisfied of our <hi>own Operations</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> and, by a <hi>paſſive Perception</hi> of <hi>various kinds</hi> and ſorts of <hi>Impreſſions</hi> by the help of certain <hi>Organs</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of the <hi>reality</hi> of things <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> us, of <hi>different Natures</hi> or <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> upon a farther Exerciſe of our <hi>active Powers,</hi> and Application of our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to external Objects, and then review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaſoning over the <hi>Obſervations</hi> that reſult from thence, we come to theſe <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Concluſions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there are a great many <hi>Changes</hi> in the World; That a great many <hi>new Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> preſent themſelves, which before were no where to be found, ſome of which are obſerved to <hi>diſappear</hi> again, as <hi>others</hi> likewiſe are, the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>original</hi> of which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52063:31"/>we never knew; That under all theſe <hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Varieties</hi> of <hi>Appearance,</hi> there is ſomething which is <hi>conſtantly the ſame</hi> which we call <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>ſolid extended Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> That the <hi>different Appearances</hi> our Senſes inform us of <hi>in Matter,</hi> proceed <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> from the Differences of <hi>Bulk</hi> or <hi>Number, Figure, Motion,</hi> and <hi>Reſt;</hi> That we are <hi>conſcious</hi> of ſeveral things in our ſelves, which we perceive as <hi>different</hi> from all <hi>theſe;</hi> That we were not <hi>always</hi> thus conſcious, but that there was a time when this <hi>Conſciouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> that we <hi>perceive</hi> in our ſelves as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from Matter, which we call <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> was <hi>joined</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to a certain portion of Matter, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>material Particles</hi> called <hi>humane Body;</hi> That, when this humane Body <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> its <hi>Appearance,</hi> and ſuch a particular <hi>Union</hi> of the parts of it is <hi>diſſolved,</hi> then that <hi>Conſciouſneſs,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>internal Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> which are now the Object of it, <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be joined with that <hi>Matter</hi> they were juſt before <hi>united</hi> to.</p>
            <p>Being well aſſured of the Truth of all theſe <hi>Concluſions,</hi> we are from thence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately led to theſe following <hi>Enquiries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How</hi> comes all this about? <hi>How</hi> came there to be ſuch a thing as <hi>Matter? When</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52063:32"/>and <hi>by what means</hi> did it <hi>exiſt?</hi> What is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Changes</hi> that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally making in it? And why does it exiſt after ſo many <hi>different manners? Whence</hi> are <hi>we</hi> our ſelves? What was it that <hi>gave</hi> us ſuch <hi>conſcious Beings? How</hi> are they <hi>united</hi> to <hi>Matter?</hi> What <hi>limits</hi> the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and afterward <hi>diſſolves</hi> the Bond of this wonderful <hi>Union?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in purſuance of theſe Enquiries, we find it utterly <hi>inconceivable</hi> and <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> that any thing ſhould <hi>make it ſelf;</hi> that a <hi>Being</hi> which once did not exiſt ſhould <hi>begin</hi> to be <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> by the force of its <hi>own</hi> Nature or Power, without the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>ſome other</hi> Being which exiſted <hi>before</hi> it: From whence we are <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> convinc'd that ſomething muſt be <hi>eternal,</hi> otherwiſe nothing could ever have been; for if any Time can be ſuppoſed in which <hi>nothing</hi> did exiſt, <hi>nothing</hi> would <hi>ever</hi> have exiſted at all, unleſs a Being that once <hi>was not</hi> could <hi>put it ſelf</hi> into Being; but that is <hi>impoſſible,</hi> and 'tis <hi>certain</hi> ſomething <hi>now</hi> really <hi>is,</hi> therefore ſomething muſt be <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as from hence 'tis evident that <hi>ſomething</hi> muſt be <hi>eternal,</hi> ſo 'tis plain from the <hi>ſeveral Changes</hi> we obſerve in the World,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52063:32"/>the Succeſſion of <hi>new conſcious Beings,</hi> and <hi>different Diſpoſitions</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> that <hi>every</hi> thing is not ſo; now, if ſomething be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and a great many things are not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then it plainly follows, that every thing that is <hi>not eternal</hi> was <hi>made</hi> by that which <hi>is; (i. e.) originally</hi> received its <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and whatever belongs to it, from an <hi>eternal Author</hi> or <hi>Cauſe:</hi> otherwiſe, either ſomething muſt be ſuppoſed to have <hi>made it ſelf,</hi> which before is proved to be <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> or <hi>one temporary</hi> Being muſt make <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> which it cannot do but by the Force and Efficacy of <hi>ſuch Powers</hi> which together with its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> it <hi>received</hi> from ſome <hi>other</hi> Being, and ſo on till we come to the <hi>eternal Fountain</hi> of <hi>all Power</hi> and <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Queſtion then is, <hi>What is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi> for upon this depends the Reſolution of all our other Doubts and Enquiries: For the better and more certain Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which, I ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider all the <hi>Claims</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions</hi> made to this glorious Prerogative of <hi>eternal Exiſtence:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, I ſhall examine what thoſe <hi>Attributes</hi> are that muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> belong to an <hi>eternal</hi> Being:</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52063:33"/>
            <p>And then ſhew that <hi>that Being</hi> to which all <hi>theſe Attributes</hi> agree, is what we call <hi>God,</hi> and there is <hi>no other</hi> Being that <hi>is</hi> or <hi>can be</hi> inveſted with the <hi>like</hi> Characters.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, As to the <hi>Claims</hi> and <hi>Pretenſions</hi> to <hi>eternal Exiſtence,</hi> theſe, I think, are all the <hi>Suppoſitions</hi> that can be made; either that <hi>Matter alone</hi> is eternal, or that the <hi>only</hi> eternal Being is what we call <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> or that <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> are <hi>both</hi> eternal.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Matter alone</hi> or <hi>co-eternal with Mind,</hi> may be conſidered under ſeveral <hi>different Reſpects:</hi> for either we imagine it as having been from all Eternity rolled up in <hi>one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> ſolid <hi>Maſs,</hi> without any <hi>Diſtinction</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> of its parts, or as <hi>looſe,</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> into innumerable little <hi>Particles,</hi> all in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Agitation</hi> or <hi>Motion;</hi> out of which <hi>quiet Maſs</hi> or <hi>moving Atoms</hi> the <hi>preſent frame of things</hi> was in time ſtruck out and <hi>form'd:</hi> or elſe we muſt ſuppoſe that the <hi>World,</hi> as it <hi>now</hi> is, has <hi>eternally</hi> exiſted under the <hi>ſame Form</hi> as to the <hi>principal parts</hi> of its <hi>Structure,</hi> with a <hi>conſtant Succeſſion</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>chief Species</hi> or ſorts of things in it.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52063:33"/>
            <p>There's nothing elſe <hi>imaginable</hi> but an <hi>eternal Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>new Worlds</hi> and <hi>new Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Beings in them; which is an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion too extravagantly abſurd to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any body: For in this Hypotheſis every new World muſt <hi>make it ſelf,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are only new <hi>Forms</hi> which all <hi>owe</hi> their <hi>Production</hi> to ſome <hi>common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> which is <hi>eternally</hi> the <hi>ſame,</hi> and then the Hypotheſis falls in with ſome other before mention'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But which of thoſe has <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of its ſide, is the next thing to be enquired into; and the Matter will beſt be determin'd by conſidering the <hi>neceſſary Attributes</hi> and Characters of an <hi>eternal Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been proved already, that <hi>all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> which exiſt <hi>in Time</hi> muſt be <hi>made</hi> by ſomething that was <hi>eternal,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>impoſſible</hi> they ſhould have exiſted any <hi>other way:</hi> The ſame will now appear <hi>à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi> from the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>eternal Being,</hi> the <hi>inſeparable Characters</hi> of which are <hi>neceſſary Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>all poſſible Perfection;</hi> which are <hi>both</hi> included in the <hi>Notion</hi> of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being, and both evidently infer one another: ſo that an <hi>eternal Being</hi> muſt <hi>exiſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52063:34"/>neceſſarily,</hi> and have <hi>all poſſible Perfection;</hi> and whatever <hi>exiſts neceſſarily</hi> muſt have <hi>all poſſible Perfection;</hi> and whatever has <hi>all poſſible Perfection</hi> muſt <hi>exiſt neceſſarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An eternal Being muſt <hi>exiſt neceſſarily</hi> becauſe it exiſts <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> by the <hi>nature</hi> of its <hi>own</hi> Being; for it <hi>always was</hi> what it <hi>is,</hi> it <hi>always</hi> had the <hi>ſame Nature</hi> it has, and therefore there <hi>always</hi> was the <hi>ſame Reaſon,</hi> which is the <hi>ſame neceſſity</hi> for its exiſting; which may farther be proved thus:</p>
            <p>That Being is ſaid to <hi>exiſt neceſſarily</hi> which <hi>not to have exiſted</hi> we conceive utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>impoſſible,</hi> but 'tis utterly impoſſible that what we allow to be an <hi>eternal Being</hi> might <hi>not have exiſted:</hi> For then we muſt ſuppoſe ſome <hi>Power</hi> ſufficient to <hi>hinder</hi> its Exiſtence, which we cannot do without allowing the Exiſtence of <hi>ſome other</hi> eternal Being by whoſe <hi>free Power This exiſts</hi> to which we deny a <hi>neceſſity of Exiſtence;</hi> but then what we take from the <hi>one</hi> muſt be granted to the <hi>other,</hi> and there muſt be ſome <hi>original</hi> eternal Being which <hi>always neceſſarily exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> and this is ſufficient to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, tho' I think it may be proved alſo, that there can be no <hi>eternal Derivations</hi> or <hi>Emanations</hi> from <hi>this Fountain</hi> but muſt have the <hi>ſame</hi> neceſſity of Exiſtence as the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52063:34"/>
               <hi>original Being</hi> from whence they flow.</p>
            <p>The other neceſſary Character of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being is, that it has <hi>all poſſible Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that is, that there is nothing <hi>conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> or in the Nature of things <hi>poſſible,</hi> which added to it would give it any <hi>Advantage,</hi> or in any ſenſe render it <hi>more perfect</hi> than it is.</p>
            <p>This is a plain and certain <hi>Conſequence</hi> of <hi>its neceſſary Exiſtence;</hi> for if <hi>any Perfection</hi> was wanting, then a Being of <hi>greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> might be conceived <hi>poſſible,</hi> which could have hinder'd the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>this;</hi> and if ſo, then its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> is not <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> becauſe it is not impoſſible but it might <hi>not have exiſted;</hi> but an <hi>eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> does <hi>exiſt neceſſarily,</hi> as has been proved before, therefore it is endued with <hi>all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, if there <hi>can</hi> be an eternal Being, neceſſarily exiſting of <hi>all poſſible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> as 'tis plain there may, whatever is <hi>eternal,</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily exiſts,</hi> muſt have alſo <hi>all other poſſible Perfection,</hi> except we ſuppoſe that <hi>two</hi> eternal neceſſary Beings of <hi>unequal Perfections,</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> of one another, <hi>may</hi> poſſibly exiſt at the <hi>ſame time;</hi> which is an Abſurdity there's no manner of countenance or colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52063:35"/>for. For why ſhould not <hi>one</hi> eternal neceſſary Being have <hi>as much</hi> Perfection as <hi>another,</hi> when <hi>both</hi> are ſuppoſed <hi>independent</hi> and <hi>neither</hi> of them to have any <hi>other</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of its Exiſtence and Perfection but <hi>its ſelf?</hi> Why ſhould the <hi>one</hi> limit its own Perfections, and the <hi>other</hi> not? Or, if it could not have from it ſelf any more, whence ſhould this <hi>Impotence</hi> proceed in <hi>one</hi> eternal neceſſary Being, which was not in <hi>another? Eternity</hi> and <hi>neceſſity of Exiſtence</hi> are the <hi>ſame</hi> in <hi>both;</hi> whatever is eternal and neceſſary is <hi>equally</hi> ſo; and therefore where-ever <hi>theſe Attributes</hi> are found, there muſt be the <hi>ſame Powers,</hi> and all the <hi>like Conſequences</hi> muſt flow from them.</p>
            <p>Another way of proving that an <hi>eternal Being</hi> muſt have <hi>all Perfection poſſible</hi> is, that the very Notion of <hi>Poſſibility</hi> does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Power</hi> ſomewhere correſpondent to the utmoſt <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> of things <hi>poſſible;</hi> ſo that to ſay a thing is <hi>poſſible,</hi> is to ſay, there is ſome <hi>Power</hi> capable of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing</hi> or <hi>having</hi> it; and therefore if you ſuppoſe an <hi>eternal neceſſary Being</hi> to <hi>want</hi> any <hi>Perfection,</hi> what is imagin'd to be <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to it muſt be, for that very reaſon, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:</hi> For it cannot be conceived to <hi>want</hi> what is in its <hi>own Power</hi> to <hi>have,</hi> and it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52063:35"/>can receive nothing from <hi>any other</hi> Being: For no other Being of <hi>greater Power</hi> is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable</hi> or <hi>poſſible;</hi> not a <hi>temporary</hi> Being, becauſe its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that which was <hi>eternal;</hi> not an <hi>eternal neceſſary</hi> Being, becauſe <hi>this</hi> which is ſuppoſed <hi>imperfect</hi> is <hi>as much</hi> an <hi>eternal neceſſary</hi> Being as the <hi>other,</hi> and therefore muſt have all the <hi>ſame Perfections:</hi> So that when I ſay that the <hi>Perfection</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>wanting</hi> is, for that reaſon, <hi>impoſſible,</hi> I do not mean only that 'tis <hi>now impoſſible,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>preſent</hi> Conſtitution of things, but that 'twas <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> impoſſible; becauſe there <hi>never</hi> could be any <hi>greater Power</hi> than what an <hi>eternal neceſſary Being</hi> muſt have.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now if <hi>ſomething</hi> certainly is <hi>eternal,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Exiſtence,</hi> and <hi>all poſſible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> are the <hi>eſſential Characters</hi> of an <hi>eternal Being,</hi> as has ſufficiently been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then <hi>this eternal Being</hi> muſt be what we call <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of an <hi>eternal Being</hi> belonging to <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>no other,</hi> as will eaſily appear by applying them to the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52063:36"/>
            <p>That <hi>thinking,</hi> and <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pleaſure,</hi> are <hi>Perfections,</hi> cannot be doubted of by us <hi>Men,</hi> who can frame no Notions of <hi>any other, every thing elſe</hi> owing all the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> it is eſteem'd for to <hi>its Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Subſerviency</hi> to <hi>theſe.</hi> For were there no Beings that enjoyed <hi>theſe Perfections,</hi> there would be no difference betwixt a <hi>regular World</hi> and a <hi>Chaos, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity</hi> and <hi>Variety of Being,</hi> and eternal <hi>univerſal Nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe therefore muſt be the <hi>principal Characters</hi> of an <hi>eternal Being;</hi> and his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> (which is his <hi>Will</hi>) and his <hi>Happineſs,</hi> muſt be <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate</hi> to his <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> that is <hi>eternal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> Qualifications, bounded only by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and whatever elſe is <hi>made</hi> by this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being, as 'tis proved every thing <hi>is</hi> that <hi>is made,</hi> muſt be made for <hi>his good Pleaſure,</hi> and the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>thoſe Beings</hi> which are capable of it; there being no other <hi>end</hi> that <hi>ſuch a Being</hi> as we here ſuppoſe can <hi>act</hi> upon; and all his <hi>Works</hi> muſt carry the Marks of their <hi>Author</hi> upon them, that is, be ſuch as are fit for a Being of <hi>thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Qualifications</hi> to <hi>make</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> for <hi>ſuch Ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52063:36"/>
            <p>Thus may the <hi>whole Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as it is before deſcribed, be eaſily made out by <hi>poſitive direct conſequence</hi> from the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> juſt now laid down and proved; as plainly appears from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of the <hi>Principles themſelves,</hi> and <hi>thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> I have given in the <hi>chief</hi> and moſt <hi>diſtinguiſhing,</hi> moſt <hi>conteſted</hi> Characters of the Deity.</p>
            <p>But I am ſenſible this way of proving a God, tho' in it ſelf the trueſt and moſt concluding, and the only <hi>direct</hi> way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating this Truth, as proceeding by a <hi>regular Connexion</hi> of plain intelligible <hi>Ideas,</hi> the <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of which are as much known to us, as thoſe of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> and <hi>Numbers;</hi> I am ſenſible, I ſay, that notwithſtanding all this, the Proof I have now given of a God is not like to meet with <hi>ſo general</hi> an Acceptance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>ſo far</hi> as a <hi>leſſer degree</hi> of Evidence in <hi>another kind;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> conſiſting of a great many parts, and the <hi>Ideas</hi> upon which it is founded being <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intellectual,</hi> and not admitting of any <hi>ſenſible Repreſentation,</hi> there are but few that are capable of ſo much <hi>Steadineſs</hi> and <hi>Attention</hi> of Mind as is required to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>whole force</hi> of the Proof.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52063:37"/>
            <p>But then 'tis certain, that <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>deny a God</hi> muſt not own themſelves to be of this number, becauſe they will from hence be proved to act very unreaſonably in <hi>denying</hi> what, by their own Confeſſion, they <hi>do not underſtand,</hi> and conſequently are not <hi>fit Judges</hi> of; which is as abſurd as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>Propoſition</hi> in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> without being able to underſtand the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> given of it: and here it will be allowed by all, that the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> is never the <hi>leſs true</hi> and <hi>concluding,</hi> becauſe there are but few that have made ſo great a progreſs in <hi>this Science,</hi> and are ſo well vers'd in <hi>this ſort of reaſoning</hi> as to perceive the <hi>Validity</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I hope I may be excuſed if I have ſpent ſome time and pains in what may be call'd a <hi>metaphyſical abſtracted proof</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> for the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of ſuch as by ſteady Reflexion and a juſt Uſe of their Reaſon will eaſily underſtand it, and for the <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> of thoſe, who renouncing <hi>common Opinions</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> upon no <hi>Grounds,</hi> pretend to <hi>new Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in Matters they <hi>do not underſtand,</hi> and conſequently <hi>cannot diſprove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, I have been as ſhort as I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could upon the <hi>poſitive</hi> part of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52063:37"/>Argument, and as plain as the Subject would give me leave, having made uſe of the <hi>commoneſt eaſieſt</hi> Terms the Language would furniſh me with upon ſuch Matters as I have had occaſion to ſpeak of: ſo that all the Difficulty I can imagine in the Apprehenſion of what I have ſaid, muſt ariſe from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Ideas</hi> and from the <hi>connexion</hi> and <hi>variety of Conſequences,</hi> which are not eaſily to be <hi>comprehended</hi> in <hi>one view</hi> without any Aſſiſtance from <hi>Senſe.</hi> But this could not be avoided.</p>
            <p>Having therefore as <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> as I could, in a <hi>poſitive direct</hi> manner proved that <hi>there is a God,</hi> by ſhewing, That there certainly <hi>is</hi> ſome <hi>eternal Being;</hi> that all the <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of an eternal Being do <hi>agree</hi> and <hi>belong</hi> to <hi>that Idea</hi> we have conceived of <hi>God;</hi> and that therefore <hi>that eternal Being,</hi> which <hi>certainly is,</hi> is <hi>as certainly</hi> what we call <hi>God:</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I ſay, <hi>poſitively</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> proved this, I proceed to make good the ſame Truth <hi>negatively</hi> or <hi>by way of Conſequence;</hi> which, taking this for proved That <hi>there is ſome eternal Being,</hi> I do by ſhewing that the <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of an eternal Being can agree to <hi>nothing</hi> elſe but what
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52063:38"/>we call <hi>God,</hi> therefore they muſt agree to <hi>God,</hi> therefore <hi>that eternal Being</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is, muſt be <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of which Argument, tho' I make uſe of the <hi>Principles</hi> inſiſted upon in the former, and the <hi>Concluſions</hi> from them not being <hi>direct,</hi> have not in <hi>their own nature</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> degree of Evidence as <hi>poſitive immediate Deductions</hi> have, yet I queſtion not but I ſhall be better and more generally underſtood, and more ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prove what I have undertaken, to a great many Perſons <hi>this</hi> way than <hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been proved already from the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exiſtence</hi> of things, that ſomething muſt be <hi>eternal;</hi> we have reckon'd up the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pretenſions that can be made to <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and conſider'd the <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of an eternal Being.</p>
            <p>Now, if that which is eternal <hi>be not God,</hi> and the Characters and Attributes of an eternal Being <hi>do not belong to him,</hi> then <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> muſt be eternal, and ſome other of the fore mention'd Suppoſitions muſt be true; but upon Examination, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be found that <hi>none</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which <hi>exclude the being of a God</hi> can be true; and therefore, what I have, proved concerning God muſt ſtand Good.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52063:38"/>
            <p>This it is my preſent Buſineſs to ſhew; and moreover I ſhall endeavour to make it appear, that as <hi>God</hi> is certainly <hi>eternal,</hi> and <hi>nothing elſe</hi> can be eternal <hi>excluſive</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> ſo likewiſe he is the <hi>only eternal Being,</hi> and whatever in any of the other <hi>Hypotheſes is conceived</hi> to be eternal, if it <hi>really is</hi> ſo, muſt in ſome manner <hi>entirely belong to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, Let us frame to our ſelves a Notion of <hi>Matter alone,</hi> with its Parts all <hi>uniced</hi> and <hi>atreſt:</hi> and when we have done ſo we ſhall eaſily judge how impoſſible it is to conceive that This ſhould have exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>neceſſarily of it ſelf</hi> from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> and that <hi>in time</hi> the World, and all things in it, in the manner we <hi>now</hi> behold them, ſhould <hi>proceed from</hi> or be <hi>produced by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, without running over all the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of an eternal Being, the Abſurdity of <hi>this Suppoſition</hi> will ſufficiently appear by what we <hi>plainly perceive,</hi> and know, and what <hi>conſtantly</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> offers it ſelf to our <hi>ſenſes</hi> and <hi>underſtandings</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent frame of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solidity</hi> or the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Reſiſtance, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Figure, Motion, Perception,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> are the <hi>chief</hi> of all our Ideas, and what we are the beſt acquainted with; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52063:39"/>ſo far as we perceive them diſtinct from one another, <hi>Seperately exiſting</hi> or <hi>neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected</hi> our <hi>Reaſonings</hi> about them are the <hi>ſureſt</hi> of any we have; ſo that, if we are <hi>miſtaken</hi> in <hi>theſe,</hi> I cannot ſee how we <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>are capable</hi> of having, any <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solidity, Extenſion,</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> I do not only perceive to be <hi>conſtantly united,</hi> but <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>inſeparably</hi> to co-exiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame <hi>Subject,</hi> which I call <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Body;</hi> ſo that, wherever any one of <hi>theſe</hi> is found, I certainly conclude from thence, that there are the <hi>other two</hi> alſo; but it does not follow, that where ever <hi>theſe three</hi> co-exiſt together <hi>there</hi> is <hi>Motion, Perception,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> there being no <hi>neceſſary Connexion</hi> between <hi>any</hi> of <hi>theſe Ideas</hi> and the <hi>other Ideas</hi> of Matter before mentioned, as is plain, not only from the <hi>Natures</hi> of the Ideas themſelves, but from their <hi>ſeparate Exiſtence</hi> actually perceived by us.</p>
            <p>How then does <hi>Matter,</hi> which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to exiſt without any <hi>Motion, Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> come to have <hi>Motion</hi> added to it?</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Motion</hi> we perceive in <hi>Bodies without us</hi> is made by <hi>Succeſſive Impulſes</hi> from from one Body to another, where <hi>every por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52063:39"/>of Matter owes its Motion to <hi>ſome other,</hi> but this cannot help us to conceive how <hi>Motion</hi> ſhould <hi>begin</hi> where every thing is <hi>at reſt:</hi> the only <hi>Idea</hi> we receive from <hi>Body in Motion</hi> is that of a <hi>Capacity of being moved</hi> when it is at reſt, and not of a <hi>power of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its ſelf:</hi> this we have from what paſſes <hi>within us,</hi> when, without any <hi>external Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe</hi> upon us, by a <hi>bare Thought or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of our ſelves we begin a Motion in our <hi>own Bodies</hi> and, by that means, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> it to <hi>others</hi> which were before at reſt; which <hi>power of beginning Motion</hi> we call <hi>Will:</hi> but <hi>Matter</hi> is ſuppoſed to exiſt without <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without this <hi>power of beginning</hi> Motion <hi>in its ſelf;</hi> and there being <hi>nothing elſe</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> it to it, it muſt <hi>eternally continue</hi> in the ſame ſtate of <hi>Union, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> and <hi>Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There needs no more for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing <hi>this Hypotheſis,</hi> no ſtreſs being ever laid upon it.</p>
            <p>In the next place then, if we imagine <hi>all the parts</hi> of this Material World <hi>looſe</hi> from one another, and all <hi>in motion,</hi> 'twill be quite as irrational to think that ſo it muſt have been <hi>eternally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> till
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52063:40"/>at <hi>ſome certain time</hi> the <hi>ſcattered moving Atoms met together,</hi> or were <hi>diſpoſed</hi> after ſuch a manner as produced the <hi>preſent Structure</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of things.</p>
            <p>Many are the <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and <hi>Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtencies</hi> this Opinion is chargeable with; but I ſhall at preſent inſtance but in two.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, the ſuppoſing an <hi>eternal motion</hi> of <hi>different Particles</hi> of <hi>Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Production</hi> of the World; which implies an <hi>infinite ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Effects</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>any Cauſe</hi> to produce them: For <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being ſomething <hi>diſtinct</hi> from <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>ſeparable</hi> from it, does not <hi>neceſſarily exiſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>Matter</hi> exiſts, for then it would <hi>always</hi> exiſt in <hi>every Particle</hi> of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> nor does it exiſt <hi>of it ſelf</hi> by a <hi>neceſſity independent</hi> of the neceſſity of <hi>Matter</hi>'s Exiſtence, becauſe it cannot exiſt <hi>without it;</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> could not produce it in its ſelf <hi>from all Eternity,</hi> becauſe it cannot produce it <hi>at all;</hi> and therefore there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>eternal Motion</hi> or <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Motion</hi> in different parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe every Motion is a <hi>meer Effect</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and there is <hi>no active power</hi> any where aſſignable or conceivable that could <hi>produce</hi> or <hi>cauſe</hi> ſuch an <hi>Effect:</hi> ſo that to ſuppoſe an <hi>eternal Motion</hi> without an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52063:40"/>Power of moving,</hi> is one very great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity thoſe are guilty of that ſet up the Hypotheſis of <hi>Atoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>other</hi> is, the aſcribing ſuch <hi>new Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> to <hi>Matter and Motion</hi> together <hi>in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> of the World, as for a <hi>whole Eternity before</hi> never <hi>proceeded</hi> from them, and could not poſſibly <hi>at any time</hi> be <hi>produced</hi> by them. For <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> not implying <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Bodies in motion</hi> being now actually perceived to <hi>exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> them, and the <hi>whole Syſtem</hi> of <hi>moving Atoms</hi> being in the preſent Hypotheſis ſuppoſed ſo to exiſt <hi>before the Beginning of the World,</hi> we ſhall never be able from hence to account for the Exiſtence of Beings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> which are Qualifications, <hi>in their own Natures</hi> as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>diſtinct from</hi> thoſe of <hi>Extention, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> as <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are from <hi>one another</hi> or from <hi>any other</hi> Ideas we perceive.</p>
            <p>That <hi>theſe laſt</hi> may be, where <hi>the other</hi> are not, is plain: How then do <hi>thoſe other</hi> come to be added to them? If <hi>Matter at reſt, whatever</hi> degree of <hi>Extention</hi> or kind of <hi>Figure</hi> it is imagin'd to have, can never make us conceive any <hi>poſſibility of Motion</hi> in it without the help of <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52063:41"/>
               <hi>Extention</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> neither can <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> together, what-ever variety of <hi>Bulk, Texture,</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to our ſelves, give us any Idea of <hi>perception</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> or a <hi>power of producing</hi> them: But <hi>Matter in motion</hi> muſt <hi>eternally move</hi> on, or <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>move by turns</hi> if you pleaſe, without advancing to any <hi>new Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:</hi> which is too plain to need any proof, if it had not been very <hi>learnedly</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> made out already by others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not enlarge in the Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>matter,</hi> nor expoſe this ridiculous Scheme <hi>of things</hi> by ſhewing all the <hi>peculiar Inconſiſtencies</hi> in it; but leave the farther Diſproof of it to thoſe <hi>general</hi> Arguments, which equally conclude againſt <hi>all</hi> the falſe Hypotheſes concerning the <hi>being of the World,</hi> which I reſerve till I have done with them in particular.</p>
            <p>And the next of them to be conſidered is that in which it is ſuppoſed that the World has <hi>eternally exiſted</hi> under the <hi>ſame Form</hi> that we now behold it, as to the <hi>principal parts</hi> of its Structure, with a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Succeſſion</hi> of ſeveral of the <hi>chief Species</hi> or ſorts of things in it.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52063:41"/>
            <p>This Opinion of the <hi>Eternity of the World</hi> has been the moſt exploded of any, tho' moſt of the Favourers of it have at the ſame time aſſerted the <hi>eternal Exiſtence of a God</hi> too; and the Reaſon of this is, becauſe the greateſt part of the <hi>most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>learned Men</hi> thought they perceived ſuch viſible Marks and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the <hi>Newneſs of the World,</hi> in the <hi>Riſe, Propagation,</hi> and <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Governments, Languages</hi> and <hi>Laws, Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences;</hi> and the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> and <hi>Beginning</hi> of Things was in <hi>their time</hi> ſo <hi>freſh,</hi> and ſo <hi>generally</hi> received in all Countries, that few of them were able to reconcile all this with the <hi>eternal Duration</hi> of <hi>the World:</hi> And <hi>this Tradition</hi> having all along <hi>continued,</hi> and the Truth of <hi>thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Obſervations</hi> having been more and more confirm'd by <hi>many new Inventions</hi> of things <hi>ſince,</hi> and ſome of them of ſuch <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Uſe</hi> that 'tis impoſſible to imagine they ſhould not have been invented <hi>before</hi> if the World had been of <hi>a very long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,</hi> or have been loſt again after they were once invented, the <hi>ſame Objections</hi> have conſtantly lain againſt the <hi>Eternity of the World;</hi> and theſe have been ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd by ſeveral <hi>other Arguments</hi> drawn from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52063:42"/>the many <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and <hi>Inconſiſtencies</hi> that ſeem to be implied in the Notion of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Succeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, and whatever elſe can be ſaid againſt the <hi>Eternity of the World</hi> when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>together with</hi> the <hi>eternal Exiſtence of a God,</hi> do more ſtrongly conclude againſt this Suppoſition, when the <hi>Being of a God</hi> is not taken into it, under which reſpect I now conſider it; and thus conſider'd, it is moreover, beſides what has been already alledg'd, attended with the <hi>ſame Difficulties</hi> and chargeable with the <hi>ſame Objections</hi> as the <hi>former Hypotheſis</hi> was.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> were no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>eternally producing</hi> ſuch a Succeſſion of various Objects as we perceive in the World, than they were of producing them and the World together <hi>in time;</hi> and yet, if we ſuppoſe an <hi>eternal Succeſſion</hi> of new Objects <hi>without a God,</hi> they muſt all be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Power of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion:</hi> For every <hi>particular new Object,</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>in time,</hi> muſt owe its Being to that which was <hi>eternal;</hi> and nothing in this Suppoſition being <hi>eternal</hi> but <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> which, under all <hi>Changes,</hi> continue the <hi>ſame,</hi> every <hi>new Generation</hi> of Beings muſt have their <hi>Original</hi> from <hi>theſe,</hi> the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52063:42"/>
               <hi>precedent Generation</hi> having no other <hi>Powers</hi> nor <hi>Differences</hi> from the <hi>ſucceeding,</hi> but what ariſe from the <hi>various Diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is plain as to all ſuch Beings as want the Faculties of <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> and, upon Examination, the Caſe will be found to be the ſame with reſpect to ſuch as are endued with <hi>theſe Qualifications:</hi> For even <hi>theſe</hi> alſo, in the preſent Hypotheſis, muſt be allowed to derive their <hi>whole Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> becauſe they are <hi>temporary Beings,</hi> which <hi>began</hi> to be, and there is <hi>nothing elſe eternal</hi> but <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> and conſequently there is no other <hi>Cauſe</hi> aſſignable for their <hi>Production.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which need not be proved to thoſe who hold the Eternity of the World <hi>without a God,</hi> becauſe there are none, I believe, of this Opinion, but do aſcribe the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Matter and Motion,</hi> making the <hi>former</hi> only different <hi>Modiſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>latter:</hi> in which they act very conſiſtently with themſelves, in making an abſurd Scheme all of a piece, not blending <hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>Falſhood,</hi> but taking in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Abſurdities</hi> that do any way depend upon one another, and belong to the main buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52063:43"/>
            <p>However, that I may leave no room for Exception from any ſide, I think my ſelf obliged to ſhew that, if <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> are not the <hi>Iſſue</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> as has already been ſhewn they are not, the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>intelligent Beings</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>God</hi> is <hi>inconceivable</hi> and <hi>impoſſible;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>no other Cauſe</hi> of their Production can be aſſigned.</p>
            <p>For ſuppoſe it ſhould be enquired how ſuch a <hi>purticular man</hi> came to <hi>exiſt,</hi> how he came to <hi>begin</hi> to be a <hi>conſcious Being,</hi> he did not <hi>put himſelf</hi> together in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we now perceive him to exiſt, he did not <hi>give himſelf</hi> thoſe <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> he is <hi>conſcious</hi> of, together with his <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> of them; this is a flat <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and granted to be ſo on all hands.</p>
            <p>Whence then did he derive this mighty <hi>Difference of Being</hi> we perceive in him, by which he is diſtinguiſh'd from all other that fall under our Cognizance? Not from <hi>ſome intelligent Being</hi> of infinitely <hi>greater Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> of the <hi>like kind</hi> with thoſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in himſelf; not from any <hi>mechanical Powers</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion:</hi> both theſe Cauſes are ſet aſide in the preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52063:43"/>
            <p>Nothing then remains, but that the Man which <hi>now exiſts,</hi> and <hi>ſometime ago began to be,</hi> muſt have received his <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>Qualifications</hi> which diſtinguiſh him from Matter, from <hi>ſome other man</hi> of the <hi>like nature</hi> with himſelf, who exiſted <hi>before</hi> him; but this is <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>irrational,</hi> not only upon the account of the <hi>infinite Subordination</hi> of <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> which follows from this Suppoſition, which, by every body, is rejected as a ſhocking repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Notion; but becauſe it is hereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that <hi>one Being</hi> may <hi>ſolely</hi> by <hi>its own power produce another</hi> Being of the <hi>ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> with its ſelf, which I take to be the next <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> to a <hi>Being's making it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſuppoſing the Exiſtence of a God, and that that may be allowed we have ſeen before, 'tis impoſſible that <hi>God</hi> ſhould have <hi>another God</hi> of <hi>all the like Perfections</hi> with himſelf, but of a <hi>diſtinct Exiſtence,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him: in like manner, we conceive it utterly impoſſible that any kind of <hi>Matter</hi> ſhould <hi>produce</hi> the <hi>leaſt new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of Matter: nay, <hi>one part</hi> of Matter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imparts any <hi>Motion</hi> to <hi>another</hi> without loſing its ſelf what the <hi>other</hi> receives; and in all other <hi>material Productions</hi> there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52063:44"/>a <hi>new diſpoſition of the parts of Matter,</hi> and not any <hi>new Being</hi> of a <hi>diſtinct Nature</hi> from it; which new Diſpoſition is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>entirely</hi> from ſome <hi>other Being of the ſame kind</hi> or <hi>texture</hi> with its ſelf, but from <hi>material Particles</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> conveyed from <hi>ſeveral diſtant</hi> parts of Nature; and yet ſuch <hi>different diſpoſitions of Matter</hi> as are obſerv'd in the World cannot be conceived to be the <hi>product</hi> of <hi>Matter and Motion alone,</hi> without the Aſſiſtance and Regulation of ſome <hi>other Being</hi> of <hi>higher Perfections,</hi> as has been ſhewn before. How then is it poſſible that <hi>one Mind</hi> or <hi>conſcious Being</hi> ſhould produce <hi>another entire diſtinct</hi> Mind or Being of equal Perfections with its ſelf, without loſing any thing from it ſelf, or <hi>borrowing</hi> any Aſſiſtance from any other kind of Being exiſting in the World? and what is as ſtrange, do all this without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>conſcious</hi> of <hi>this</hi> its <hi>chief Perfection,</hi> as well as it is of all its <hi>other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I ſay, cannot poſſibly be; and therefore, if the World be <hi>eternal without a God,</hi> all the <hi>continual Changes</hi> and <hi>new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> that have ever been in it muſt be aſcribed to <hi>matter and Motion;</hi> but, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion not being able to <hi>produce ſuch Effects,</hi> from hence I conclude that the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52063:44"/>
               <hi>Eternity of the World</hi> conſidered as it now is, <hi>without the eternal Exiſtence of a God</hi> is <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have conſider'd all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> which pretend to give any account of the preſent Conſtitution of things called the <hi>World, with excluſion to the Being of a God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now take a ſhort Review of each of them <hi>in conjunction with the Exiſtence of a God,</hi> and then paſs to more <hi>general Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions</hi> to ſhew the <hi>Incompetency</hi> and Falſhood of <hi>any other</hi> account whatſoever that can be given of the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of things beſides that of their <hi>proceeding in ſome manner from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, before I enter upon the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>theſe Hypotheſes,</hi> which do all, tho' in different manners, eſtabliſh an <hi>eternal Co-exiſtence</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> I think it neceſſary to premiſe ſomething concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of theſe two kind of Beings, as far as we are capable of perceiving them; that ſo I may cut off a great many <hi>Diſputes</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes</hi> occaſion'd by the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of our Ideas upon this Subject, and what I have to ſay afterwards may be better underſtood.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52063:45"/>
            <p>I do not perceive any ſuch <hi>Connexion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Ideas of <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> that where-ever the <hi>former</hi> are, there muſt the <hi>latter</hi> be alſo; nor do I ſee any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> may not exiſt <hi>ſeparately</hi> from <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as well as <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may exiſt <hi>ſeparately</hi> from <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> only becauſe <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>actually</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo to exiſt, and we have not yet been <hi>actually conſcious</hi> of ſuch a ſeparate Exiſtence of <hi>the other.</hi> But this does not hinder but that <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will may ſo exiſt,</hi> and have a <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of their own, <hi>diſtinct</hi> from that which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports theſe Qualities of <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>

            <p>If <hi>Thinking</hi> and <hi>Willing</hi> were <hi>common</hi> to <hi>every Being</hi> we knew, we could no more frame an Idea of a <hi>pure material Subſtance</hi> exiſting without <hi>theſe Qualifications,</hi> than we can now of a <hi>pure thinking Subſtance,</hi> exiſting without <hi>thoſe Qualities</hi> we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Matter only:</hi> but 'tis certain from an <hi>actual Separation</hi> of <hi>theſe different Ideas</hi> perceivable in <hi>different Subjects,</hi> that <hi>ſome</hi> of them may exiſt without <hi>the other,</hi> tho' without this <hi>actual Separation</hi> we could not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52063:45"/>have been ſo <hi>certain</hi> of it; and therefore, tho' <hi>the other</hi> have never yet been <hi>perceived</hi> to <hi>exist ſeparately</hi> from <hi>theſe,</hi> it does not follow from thence that they <hi>cannot</hi> ſo exiſt: but, conſidering the vaſt <hi>diſtance</hi> and <hi>diſtinction</hi> in the <hi>Natures</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Ideas,</hi> without any <hi>conceivable Reſemblance</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> to one another, 'tis <hi>very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> they do <hi>ariſe</hi> from <hi>different Principles,</hi> and are founded in <hi>different Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, having no farther Certainty of it from <hi>natural Reaſon,</hi> and I purpoſely wave all other Proof at preſent, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will, Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> have all the <hi>ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Subject</hi> to ſupport them, are <hi>radically</hi> and <hi>ultimately</hi> founded in the <hi>ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and iſſue from the <hi>ſame Principle;</hi> which <hi>Subject, Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> we know nothing more of than that it is <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> which <hi>ſuſtains</hi> theſe different <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or whatever elſe we call them, which could not <hi>exiſt</hi> of themſelves <hi>without it:</hi> Suppoſing, I ſay, all this, 'tis ridiculouſly, and without any colour of Reaſon, inferr'd from hence, that therefore <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> are only different <hi>Modifications</hi> or <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> of <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> or do in ſome manner or other wholly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52063:46"/>from them: For why may not <hi>diſtinct Qualities co-exist</hi> together in the ſame <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> without being <hi>made one from another?</hi> or why ſhould <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications</hi> of <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> any more than <hi>Extenſion, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are different <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will?</hi> I cannot ſee what ground they can have for the contrary of either of theſe, who affirm what we call the <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> of Man to be nothing elſe but <hi>Matter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a peculiar <hi>Diſpoſition of its Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that <hi>Thinking</hi> and <hi>Willing,</hi> upon a Suppoſition that they actually exiſt <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> exiſt <hi>without it,</hi> are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Modifications</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>other Qualities</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> which are antecedently in it before the Addition of <hi>theſe,</hi> may be farther illuſtrated by this Inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motion</hi> is ſomething <hi>added</hi> to the <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> Qualities of <hi>Matter,</hi> owes its <hi>Capacity of exiſting</hi> to it, and cannot exiſt <hi>without it;</hi> but 'tis plain that <hi>Motion</hi> is no <hi>Extenſion</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>Solidity, Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> which are every thing we conceive in <hi>Motion</hi> before <hi>Matter</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it; but ſomething in <hi>its own nature diſtinct</hi> from <hi>all theſe,</hi> and not <hi>reſulting</hi> from any conceivable Difference of them: So
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52063:46"/>that it does not follow that, becauſe <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is <hi>ſolid,</hi> or ſo and ſo <hi>extended</hi> or <hi>figured,</hi> that therefore it muſt be <hi>in motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be true of <hi>Motion,</hi> it muſt be much more ſo of <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will:</hi> For <hi>Motion</hi> does involve <hi>Matter</hi> in the very <hi>Idea</hi> of it: there's no conceiving of <hi>Motion</hi> without conceiving at the ſame time ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is <hi>moved;</hi> and I cannot conſider a thing as <hi>moved,</hi> without conſidering it as <hi>extended</hi> too, and <hi>Extenſion</hi> neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the <hi>other eſſential Properties</hi> of Matter: but I can form a Notion of <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and be conſcious of ſomething <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> and <hi>willing,</hi> without having any Ideas at the ſame time of <hi>Solidity, Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Figure,</hi> or <hi>Motion;</hi> and therefore, if <hi>Motion</hi> may be joyned to the other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of <hi>Matter</hi> without <hi>reſulting</hi> from them, tho' they are <hi>neceſſarily implied</hi> in the Idea we have of it, 'tis <hi>much more probable</hi> that <hi>Perception</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> may <hi>co-exiſt</hi> with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>material Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> without being the <hi>effects</hi> or <hi>product</hi> of them, when they carry no Marks of ſuch an <hi>Original</hi> upon them, and in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception have no manner of appearance of any <hi>Relation</hi> to them. And, if it does not follow that becauſe <hi>Matter</hi> is of ſuch a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:52063:47"/>and ſo <hi>modified,</hi> therefore it <hi>moves, much leſs</hi> can it be inferr'd that, becauſe <hi>Matter</hi> is ſo and ſo <hi>diſpoſed</hi> and <hi>moved,</hi> therefore it <hi>thinks</hi> and <hi>wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being premiſed, it plainly appears from hence, that 'tis <hi>much more probable in Reaſon</hi> that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be the <hi>only eternal Being,</hi> than that <hi>Matter,</hi> any way conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſhould be <hi>co-eternal</hi> with him: For the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Conſideration</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Addition</hi> of the Idea of <hi>Matter</hi> to it does not <hi>add</hi> any thing to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Divine Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Power of producing Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>forming</hi> an <hi>infinite variety of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> out of them, is indeed a <hi>Perfection</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy of <hi>God,</hi> and what we juſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to him; but the <hi>actual Exiſtence</hi> of any of theſe does no way <hi>heighten</hi> the Idea we have of him, whom we conceive to be <hi>as perfect in himſelf before</hi> their <hi>Exiſtence, as after it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>actual Communication</hi> of ſome of his <hi>Perfections</hi> to a particular rank of his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and the <hi>giving</hi> them the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of his <hi>other Works,</hi> do raiſe a new Idea of him in <hi>them,</hi> which they call
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52063:47"/>by the name of <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> but this they look upon only as a <hi>voluntary opening</hi> and diſcloſing the Glory of his <hi>original</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not a <hi>neceſſary additional Advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It is therefore <hi>moſt agreeable</hi> to our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and all the Notions we have of the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> ſhould have <hi>exiſted alone from all Eternity,</hi> and <hi>in time produced</hi> the <hi>World</hi> and all things in it.</p>
            <p>But, if any Man had <hi>rather</hi> believe that <hi>Matter at reſt,</hi> or <hi>Matter and Motion,</hi> or the <hi>preſent Frame of the World</hi> with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of beings in it, were <hi>co-eternal</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> he muſt at the ſame time hold that</p>
            <p>Whatever was <hi>co-eternal with God</hi> did either ſubſiſt eternally <hi>of its ſelf, dictinctly</hi> and <hi>independently</hi> of him,</p>
            <p>Or is really a <hi>neceſſary</hi> part of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature,</hi> and helps to make up the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or did <hi>eternally proceed</hi> from him becauſe he had <hi>eternally</hi> an <hi>effectual will to produce it:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, the firſt of theſe Suppoſitions cannot be true; for neither <hi>Matter it ſelf,</hi> nor <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion,</hi> nor the <hi>preſent Conſtitution of things</hi> can be eternal <hi>independently</hi> of God;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52063:48"/>becauſe, as has been fully proved already, neither of them can be ſuppoſed to have <hi>exiſted eternally without a God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which proof it ſufficiently appears, that neither of them have the <hi>eſſential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of an <hi>eternal Being</hi> viz. <hi>neceſſary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> and <hi>all poſſible Perfection;</hi> nor the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>actual production</hi> of all <hi>temporary Beings:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which ſoever of them is ſuppoſed, there are <hi>ſuppos'd</hi> alſo wanting thoſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> we aſcribe to <hi>God,</hi> which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>chief</hi> if not the only ones <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> by us. And there can be no <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Exiſtence</hi> where <hi>theſe</hi> are wanting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we may ſuppoſe a <hi>neceſſary eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being with</hi> them <hi>which will</hi> be of <hi>greater Perfections</hi> than <hi>another</hi> neceſſary eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without them; but we cannot ſuppoſe <hi>two</hi> neceſſary and independent eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>unequal Perfections,</hi> therefore what wants any of <hi>theſe Qualifications,</hi> we aſcribe to <hi>God,</hi> cannot <hi>exiſt neceſſarily</hi> and of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And further, what we ſuppoſe deſtitute of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> can have no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power of producing Temporary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, was it <hi>in its ſelf</hi> allowed to be <hi>eternal;</hi> as is manifeſt from what has been ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that exclude the Being of a God:</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52063:48"/>
            <p>And therefore what ever is ſuppoſed <hi>eternal</hi> which does not enter into the <hi>Idea</hi> we have given of <hi>God,</hi> muſt be taken into it as <hi>neceſſarily belonging</hi> to the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or be look'd upon as the <hi>free eternal effect</hi> of his <hi>eternal Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſome have affrm'd that the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>every thing</hi> we ſee or know, is <hi>God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others, that all things flowed from God; by which, if they mean <hi>neceſſary Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> they muſt be referred to his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Eſſence,</hi> if <hi>production</hi> to his <hi>Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that however we expreſs our ſelves upon theſe Matters, <hi>every thing</hi> that we can imagine; or frame any Notion of, muſt be either <hi>God,</hi> or ſome way <hi>proceed from</hi> him, be reckoned to his <hi>Nature</hi> or his <hi>Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Inference</hi> from all which is this: That 'tis <hi>moſt rational</hi> to think that no more belongs to the Idea of God than what we have before aſcribed to him, and that he did <hi>in time,</hi> of his own free will, <hi>produce every thing</hi> not contained in that Idea, even <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> as well as the <hi>frame and Structure of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>particular Beings</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>But if any Man aſſerts the <hi>Eternity</hi> of <hi>any of theſe</hi> together with <hi>God</hi> in the full
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52063:49"/>extent of the Idea we have given of him, however his Opinion may be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> it can make <hi>no change</hi> in our Thoughts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Religion:</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of God, being ſo far the <hi>ſame here</hi> as we have eſtabliſht it the <hi>ſame Conſequences</hi> will every where flow from it; and the Aſſertors of any ſuch Opinion will bear the <hi>ſame Relation</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and be under the <hi>ſame Obligations</hi> with us that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them in <hi>ſome other things</hi> relating to God; which however held, have no other <hi>Influence</hi> upon us than as we are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to Entertain any <hi>falſe Notions</hi> of God <hi>willingly</hi> when we may have <hi>better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> or, if we cannot, yet <hi>other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> may appear <hi>more ſuitable</hi> to our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and more for the <hi>Honour of God;</hi> which I take to be the preſent Caſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall wave any further Enquiry into theſe Matters, as having no proſpect of a Poſſibility of knowing any thing more about them.</p>
            <p>Thus have I, with as much Brevity and Diſpatch as the Subject would allow, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined all the Accounts that are or can be given of the <hi>preſent Exiſtence</hi> of things. And, from particular Obſervations upon each of them, not all that might be made but ſuch as I judg'd ſufficient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52063:49"/>I think, I have made it very evident, that there <hi>muſt be a God,</hi> or Being of ſuch a nature as I before deſcribed, who was the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>every thing</hi> we ſee, or know, or has over been, beſide him; and without the Suppoſition of ſuch a Being, the World could not <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi> have <hi>ever exiſted any other way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now add ſome <hi>general Reflexions</hi> to ſtrengthen the <hi>common Hypotheſis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Original of the World,</hi> and ſo conclude the Proof of a God.</p>
            <p>That the World is as we now perceive, muſt be aſcribed to <hi>Chance, Neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> but <hi>Chance</hi> is <hi>nothing, Neceſſity</hi> without a God <hi>unintelligible,</hi> and therefore <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or what is meant by it, <hi>God,</hi> who is a <hi>wiſe Being, made</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and all things in it, in the <hi>form</hi> and manner we now behold and admire.</p>
            <p>The World's being <hi>made by chance</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>we know not how,</hi> being made <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Cauſe:</hi> and to ſpeak thus, is to uſe Words without any Meaning under them.</p>
            <p>There's no Man that has made any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the Nature of Things, but knows, that nothing can <hi>be</hi> that before <hi>was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52063:50"/>not,</hi> without owing its <hi>Original</hi> to ſome <hi>real poſitive Being</hi> of <hi>antecedent Exiſtence. Inadequate</hi> and <hi>inſufficient Cauſes</hi> are often aſſigned for the <hi>Production</hi> of things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being <hi>next</hi> to, and <hi>immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> the <hi>Effects,</hi> they are <hi>ſolely</hi> taken notice of, without any regard had to their <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to,</hi> or <hi>Direction by</hi> others; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſomething is thought to be the <hi>next</hi> and <hi>immediate Cauſe</hi> of a thing which is no ways concern'd in it: but in both theſe Caſes, 'tis by reaſon of ſome <hi>real Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> obſerved that theſe Judgments are made, which muſt all proceed from ſome <hi>real Being,</hi> tho' there may be a Miſtake in attributing it to a <hi>wrong one,</hi> or to <hi>one</hi> that had only a <hi>ſhare</hi> in the Effect; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be <hi>ſomething real</hi> aſſign'd, which was <hi>as much</hi> and <hi>as properly</hi> the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>meeting of the Parts</hi> of Matter in <hi>order to make</hi> a World, as the parts of Matter <hi>ſo met</hi> were the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Production of the World;</hi> which can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch particular Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> of <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of Matter; but theſe muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>eternal,</hi> or the Effect of certain <hi>eternal ſixt Rules reſulting</hi> from the <hi>Natures</hi> of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> or be <hi>made</hi> by a <hi>divine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52063:50"/>Power;</hi> in all which there can be nothing <hi>caſual,</hi> but every thing <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, ſuppoſing the <hi>whole Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Matter ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo figured</hi> and <hi>moved,</hi> we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as <hi>indifferent</hi> to <hi>ſeveral</hi> Effects, but <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to <hi>one,</hi> which muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably follow ſuch a <hi>ſuppoſed Diſpoſition,</hi> unleſs ſomething <hi>extrinſical</hi> to <hi>Matter</hi> ſhould <hi>reſtrain</hi> or <hi>change</hi> the <hi>Determination.</hi> If any thing <hi>extrinſical</hi> to Matter, or <hi>beſides</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion be allowed, it muſt be <hi>God;</hi> if there be <hi>nothing elſe</hi> exiſting but <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> then are all the Effects reſulting from them <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> of Matter we ſuppoſe, and <hi>whenſoever</hi> in the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Eternity we ſuppoſe it, every fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Effect muſt</hi> have been what it <hi>is,</hi> and there could have been no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the room of it.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why certain Portions of Matter <hi>ſo and ſo figured</hi> and <hi>moved</hi> do not <hi>always neceſſarily</hi> produce the <hi>ſame Effects</hi> is, becauſe their <hi>particular Determinations</hi> are reſtrained or over-ruled by the <hi>neceſſary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes</hi> of <hi>other extrinſical Matter,</hi> or the greater Power of the <hi>Divine Will;</hi> which, being unperceiv'd by us, make us look
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52063:51"/>upon ſeveral of theſe <hi>particular</hi> Effects as <hi>caſual,</hi> which can only, and that very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly too <hi>with reſpect to our Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> be ſtiled ſo; whereas <hi>in reality, with reſpect</hi> to the <hi>univerſal Nature</hi> and <hi>Efficiency</hi> of things, they muſt be either <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>voluntary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we conſider the <hi>whole Frame</hi> and Collection of things <hi>together,</hi> we cannot form any ſort of Idea of <hi>Chance,</hi> either <hi>in the World as it now is,</hi> or <hi>in its original Formation,</hi> unleſs we will be ſo ridiculous as to ſay <hi>every thing</hi> that <hi>is</hi> is <hi>caſual;</hi> that every thing that <hi>has been</hi> from all Eternity <hi>happen'd by chance,</hi> and that it was <hi>by chance</hi> that <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> were <hi>eternal,</hi> or that <hi>any thing exiſted</hi> at all, <hi>Chance</hi> having the ſame Title to <hi>all</hi> theſe Effects as to <hi>any one</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>I need not conſider the other Occaſion we take of forming this Notion of <hi>Chance</hi> from the <hi>Indifference</hi> we are oftentimes conſcious of in our ſelves with regard to <hi>ſeveral contrary</hi> Actions, which makes the following of one Action rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the Cauſe ſeems equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to both, be look'd upon as <hi>a caſual Reſult</hi> rather than a <hi>proper Effect.</hi> This may be accounted for otherwiſe by the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52063:51"/>
               <hi>Preponderancy</hi> of ſome <hi>motive determining</hi> us to act <hi>this</hi> way rather than <hi>another,</hi> and the <hi>ſeeming Indifference</hi> be ſhewed to be the effect of our <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the whole Nature and all the Conſequences of the thing in queſtion, and the ſeveral Reaſons and ways of acting; but there is no occaſion for ſuch a Proof, becauſe thoſe that ſay the World was made <hi>by chance</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to uſe the Word in <hi>this Senſe,</hi> foraſmuch as they do not acknowledge that <hi>God</hi> or any <hi>intelligent Being</hi> was concern'd in <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> of it; or, if they did, would they be ſo abſurd, and entertain ſuch low No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, as to think that ſome <hi>chance Thought</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>his</hi> produced it.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain then, that <hi>Chance</hi> is nothing elſe but an <hi>inſignificant Word,</hi> and an <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Pretence,</hi> which has no <hi>Senſe</hi> nor <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> under it, and therefore can give us no manner of light in our Enquiries into the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of things.</p>
            <p>Neither will <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which is the next thing to be conſider'd, give us much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Satisfaction: For, if we examine this Notion well, 'twill evidently appear that there can be no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for the <hi>preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> of the World in the manner we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52063:52"/>
            <p>The Queſtion is not, whether 'twas <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> that <hi>God ſhould make</hi> ſuch a World as this, ſuppoſing there is a God, tho' this may eaſily be proved that 'twas not; but, whether 'twas <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> there <hi>ſhould be</hi> ſuch a World as this <hi>without a God:</hi> and I think it may be <hi>certainly demonſtrated</hi> that it was not. For nothing can be ſaid to be <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> but what 'tis altogether <hi>impoſſible</hi> ſhould be <hi>otherwiſe;</hi> but 'tis not <hi>impoſſible</hi> that the World ſhould <hi>never have exiſted,</hi> or ſhould <hi>ever be deſtroyed</hi> now it does exiſt: For if this be <hi>abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> then is it <hi>abſolutely impoſſible</hi> that there ſhould be any thing of <hi>greater Perfection</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> than the <hi>World;</hi> for if there was, <hi>that Being</hi> of greater Perfection and Power than the World could have <hi>hindred</hi> the World from <hi>exiſting,</hi> or could now <hi>deſtroy</hi> it; but 'tis not <hi>impoſſible</hi> there <hi>ſhould be</hi> ſuch a Being becauſe it is not <hi>impoſſible</hi> to <hi>conceive</hi> ſuch a Being, for what <hi>may be conceived</hi> to exiſt <hi>may</hi> exiſt.</p>
            <p>But if any Man ſhall ſay he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a Being as could <hi>hinder</hi> Matter <hi>from exiſting,</hi> or <hi>deſtroy</hi> it now it does exiſt, becauſe he cannot conceive a Power of <hi>making ſomething out of nothing,</hi> or of <hi>redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſomething</hi> to <hi>nothing,</hi> the <hi>last</hi> of which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52063:52"/>is here ſuppoſed, and no Account can be given of the <hi>preſent Exiſtence</hi> of things without allowing the <hi>firſt</hi> if <hi>ſuch a Being as this</hi> in queſtion is ſuppoſed, and the <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the World's Exiſtence</hi> is taken away: If any Man, I ſay, ſhould object this, I anſwer, that it ſeems to me <hi>conceivable</hi> enough from the <hi>Idea.</hi> I have of <hi>God,</hi> that what is here aſcribed to him may fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of his <hi>Power;</hi> which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>all</hi> things <hi>poſſible,</hi> that is, to all things which do not imply a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> may extend to the Acts of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Annihilation;</hi> which, tho' the <hi>manner</hi> of the Performance be <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> cannot be proved to carry any <hi>Contradiction</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>However, if there be thoſe that pretend they cannot <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of <hi>theſe</hi> Actions, yet <hi>this</hi> is very <hi>conceivable</hi> by any Man, that there may be <hi>ſome Being</hi> of that <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that tho' he could not <hi>hinder Matter</hi> from <hi>exiſting,</hi> or <hi>reduce</hi> it to <hi>nothing</hi> afterwards, yet he might have <hi>hinder'd</hi> it from being put into any <hi>Motion, Form,</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> it in that State, or could <hi>reduce</hi> it now to a <hi>confuſed, unmoving Chaos,</hi> or <hi>ſcatter</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>innumerable incoherent Particles.</hi> There's no manner of Difficulty for a Man to frame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52063:53"/>a Notion of theſe things, who has ſeen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Inſtances of the <hi>ſame kind of Power</hi> in a <hi>leſſer degree</hi> exerciſed by <hi>Men.</hi> And this is ſufficient to overthrow the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>preſent Frame</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of things, which was the thing deſign'd.</p>
            <p>If therefore the World and all things in it, in the Condition we now behold, do not ſubſiſt by a <hi>neceſſity of Being,</hi> nor are the <hi>reſult of Chance,</hi> it immediately follows that they are the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Product of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the <hi>Workmanſhip</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> of a <hi>wiſe Agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is certainly the moſt <hi>rational</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis that can be deviſed or imagined; for we that maintain this Opinion, have <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>diſtinct Ideas</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> by which we explain the <hi>Original</hi> of Things; but thoſe who aſcribe the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>Structure</hi> of the World to any thing elſe, have no manner of Ideas of what they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe them to. No Man has any Idea of <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> except he annexes the Idea of <hi>Power</hi> to them; and he can have no Idea of <hi>Power</hi> without <hi>Knowledge,</hi> all <hi>Power</hi> proceeding <hi>originally</hi> from <hi>Mind,</hi> which by <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> we are Senſible of, and we can frame no Notion of any other <hi>Seat</hi> or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52063:53"/>
               <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>Power;</hi> and therefore we make ſome <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>intelligent Being</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of every thing, as being the <hi>only conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Notions of <hi>Wiſdom, Contrivance, Deſign,</hi> are as <hi>clear</hi> as that of <hi>Power,</hi> and known the ſame way: And if they are ever plainly perceivable in their <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> they are ſo in the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the World,</hi> and the ſeveral parts of it. If we have any reaſon to conclude that <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> were <hi>built,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths</hi> were <hi>modell'd</hi> by the <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> of <hi>intelligent Beings,</hi> we have much more Cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Univerſe</hi> was <hi>made, faſhion'd,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> by the <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of ſome more perfect and capacious <hi>Mind;</hi> the Marks and Prints of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> being <hi>plainer</hi> and <hi>more legible</hi> in the <hi>Oeconomy of the World</hi> than any of the moſt admired <hi>Works of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, if we allow our ſelves to have any Ideas of <hi>Power and Knowledge</hi> we muſt confeſs that <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>inſeparable</hi> from <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and that there is no <hi>Power</hi> but there is ſome <hi>Knowledge commenſurate</hi> to it, it being utterly inconceivable that any thing ſhould <hi>be,</hi> or be <hi>made,</hi> which there is no Being that <hi>knows.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52063:54"/>
            <p>And this, I think is of it ſelf Ground enough to believe <hi>there is a God</hi> who was the Author of the World and every thing in it, without carrying the Proof any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but for thoſe that will not be ſatisfied with <hi>this,</hi> I have given a <hi>farther</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Being of God, not with any Hopes of convincing them, but to make it impoſſible for them to urge any thing to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thus have I finiſhed the <hi>Proof of a God,</hi> and (as I think) made it <hi>very evident,</hi> that there really <hi>is ſuch a Being,</hi> and that what we call God is a Being of <hi>ſuch a nature</hi> as I before deſcribed, inveſted with all <hi>theſe Characters</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> I there attributed to him.</p>
            <p>Which Conſiderations, together with thoſe plain and eaſy Reflexions before ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted upon our ſelves and our <hi>own Nature,</hi> if carefully attended to, will certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the <hi>Reality</hi> of <hi>all thoſe Relations</hi> I have ſuppoſed between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> and furniſh us with many <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>undeniable Arguments</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: which is the third Thing I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the principal part of the Deſign I am purſuing in this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52063:54"/>III. From the Knowledge I have ſhewn we have or are capable of having concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine Natures.</hi> I ſhall deduce a <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> Proof of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion,</hi> in ſhort, is whatever we are <hi>obliged to</hi> by <hi>God.</hi> In order therefore to prove there is ſuch a thing as Religion, we muſt ſhew that <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>capable</hi> of being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>act</hi> after ſuch a particular manner, that <hi>God</hi> has a <hi>Power</hi> of obliging him ſo to act; and that <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>actually</hi> under ſuch an Obligation, or <hi>God</hi> does <hi>actually will</hi> and require ſomething of him.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis plain by the Account we have before given of the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that conſults himſelf may find it to be ſo, that he has in ſeveral caſes a <hi>Power of determining</hi> himſelf to <hi>act</hi> or <hi>not to act,</hi> and a <hi>Power of acting</hi> or <hi>not acting</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>ſuch Determination;</hi> that he is <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced</hi> to <hi>act</hi> ſeveral ways by <hi>different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> and <hi>Proſpects;</hi> and that he oftentimes ſuffers himſelf to be influenced by <hi>certain Conſiderations,</hi> which he <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ought not</hi> to have acted by, as he plainly perceives and knows by <hi>condemning himſelf</hi> afterwards
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52063:55"/>for what he has done; and that he often <hi>neglects</hi> or <hi>refuſes</hi> to obey ſuch Motives and Incitements to Action which he <hi>ought</hi> to have followed, as his <hi>own Approbation</hi> of them before and after the Neglect or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal convinces him of. From whence it evidently follows, that a Man <hi>may be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> to act one particular way rather than another; that is, there may be ſuch <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> for his acting <hi>this way,</hi> that, upon a juſt Ballance of all the ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements that could be offered to him for <hi>any</hi> other, he muſt acknowledge <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>determine</hi> him; ſo that ſhould he act <hi>the way,</hi> he muſt <hi>neceſſarily approve himſelf,</hi> and ſhould he act <hi>any other</hi> he muſt <hi>neceſſarily condemn himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Being which has a Power of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Reaſons and Motives to any Man as theſe, may properly be ſaid to have a <hi>Power of obliging</hi> him to act ſuch or ſuch a way.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>God</hi> has this Power is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt if we conſider what it is that <hi>influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>determines</hi> us to <hi>act;</hi> which being nothing elſe but ſome kind of <hi>Pain</hi> or <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>in proſpect,</hi> God, who can do all things poſſible, and conſequently who can put us into, and continue us to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52063:55"/>all Eternity in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Pain</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> the greateſt our Natures are capable of, can, by annexing theſe to different ways of acting, offer ſuch Motives to us, as we ſhall be forced to acknowledge <hi>ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> us to act one particular way; and therefore <hi>God can,</hi> if he pleaſe, <hi>oblige</hi> us ſo to act.</p>
            <p>The only Queſtion then is, Whether we are <hi>actually</hi> under ſuch Obligation; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God has preſcribed <hi>ſuch Actions,</hi> and annexed <hi>ſuch Conſequences</hi> to different kinds of Action as make it <hi>neceſſary</hi> to our <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> to act that particular way he has preſcribed.</p>
            <p>But, before I enter upon the particular Reſolution of this Queſtion, I think it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to give a fuller Account of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of what we call <hi>Obligation</hi> or <hi>Duty,</hi> together with the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of obliging.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis plain from what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, That an <hi>Obligation</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Man</hi> is nothing elſe but ſuch a <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> as when duly offered to him <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily determines</hi> him to <hi>chuſe</hi> or <hi>prefer</hi> one way of acting before another; and this <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> can be nothing elſe but a <hi>greater degree</hi> of <hi>Miſery</hi> or <hi>Happineſs</hi> to be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52063:56"/>avoided or obtained by <hi>thus</hi> acting, than all things conſidered can be avoided or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained by acting <hi>any other way.</hi> Such a Reaſon or Motive as this, does, in the ſtricteſt and propereſt Senſe of the Word, <hi>oblige</hi> us to act according to it; or, which is all one, <hi>we ought,</hi> or <hi>it is our Duty,</hi> ſo to do; that is, we find our ſelves under a <hi>neceſſity of Judging</hi> thus.</p>
            <p>There is no other <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> of Obligation imaginable; or if there be any other pretended, upon Examination it will be found to be ultimately reſolvable into this.</p>
            <p>What is meant by the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power of obliging,</hi> in what reſpects they are the <hi>ſame,</hi> or, at leaſt, only diſtinct Conceptions of the ſame thing, and in what reſpects they are different, will plainly appear if we conſider the ſeveral Inſtances to which theſe Notions are applied.</p>
            <p>All the Beings capable of <hi>obliging</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged</hi> are thoſe we call <hi>intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> which, as far as our Knowledge, in theſe Matters reaches, are only <hi>God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether there <hi>are</hi> any <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>middle Natures</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and how they <hi>Act</hi> with regard to other intelligent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52063:56"/>Beings, <hi>natural Reaſon</hi> does not <hi>certainly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, but, <hi>in general,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>intelligent Beings</hi> we can frame any Notions of, it may be affirmed that <hi>no one</hi> has a <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Power of obliging another</hi> to act ſuch a particular way be preſcribes, any farther than he has a <hi>Power of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Happineſs or Miſery</hi> of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſo preſcribes to.</p>
            <p>Thus we are led to conclude by all we know concerning God and <hi>our ſelves;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, as to <hi>God;</hi> I am not able to comprehend, how he can any <hi>otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Obligation</hi> upon Men to obey him, or live according to the Rules he preſcribes, than by <hi>making them know</hi> that he has it <hi>in his Power</hi> to render them <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> according as they <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>diſobey</hi> him; and that he <hi>will</hi> certainly make them the one or the other, as their Actions ſhall deſerve.</p>
            <p>'Tis not his great and ſupereminent Power in creating Men and giving them <hi>Being,</hi> which is <hi>ſolely in its ſelf</hi> the ground and foundation of his Title to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: This, without a <hi>capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy,</hi> could never become a Reaſon or Motive of acting to them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, could never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> found any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52063:57"/>For was <hi>Miſery</hi> the <hi>certain unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Condition:</hi> of their <hi>being,</hi> and they were ſure their Miſery was to have <hi>no End,</hi> and was capable of <hi>no Increaſe,</hi> how could the <hi>Author of their Being</hi> be imagined <hi>to oblige</hi> them to obey his Commands, or act one way rather than another, when he could not offer or propoſe any thing to them which would <hi>determine</hi> them ſo to act; <hi>all degrees of Pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>leſſer Pain,</hi> being ſuppoſed <hi>impoſſible;</hi> ſo that which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they acted, there could be no ground for <hi>approving</hi> themſelves for it, becauſe they were not capable of that or any other Pleaſure, nor for <hi>condemning themſelves,</hi> becauſe their Miſery was not capable of that, or any other Addition. They might indeed, by an <hi>overruling Power,</hi> be <hi>forced</hi> to ſuch and ſuch Actions; but this is not a <hi>rational Obligation,</hi> which is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubmitted to as <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reaſon,</hi> and performed with the <hi>full Concurrence of the Will</hi> of thoſe that obey it.</p>
            <p>In vain then, and very falſly, do ſome nice abſtracted Thinkers magnify the <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Excellence</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>pure Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> even when joined with the <hi>extreameſt degree of Miſery:</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52063:57"/>Experience would ſoon convince them that <hi>to be,</hi> was no otherwiſe the <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of a <hi>rational Being</hi> than as it gave him a <hi>Capacity of being happy:</hi> but if they could be ſuppoſed to continue in their Opinion in ſuch a State, and think it <hi>better</hi> to <hi>be miſerable</hi> than <hi>not to be</hi> at all, the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of knowing themſelves <hi>to be</hi> muſt out-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the other <hi>Miſery</hi> they felt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, upon that account, give the Author of their Being a Title to their Obedience: but then his <hi>Right of obliging them</hi> would be <hi>ſolely founded</hi> in his <hi>Power of making them leſs</hi> or <hi>more miſerable,</hi> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, continuing, or taking away, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, they enjoy: which confirms the Truth of what I aſſert.</p>
            <p>This will farther appear if, in the next place, we conſider <hi>the Right</hi> and <hi>Power of obliging</hi> that <hi>Men</hi> have or pretend to have over one another; which, whatever <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>extent</hi> it be of, muſt be all <hi>founded in,</hi> and <hi>commenſurate to,</hi> their <hi>power of contributing to the Happineſs or Miſery</hi> of one another.</p>
            <p>But oftentimes it ſo happens, that ſome Men demand to be obeyed by others, and require them to live according to their Orders and Directions, when, at the ſame time, they have no Power, nor ever will

Upon which account, the <hi>Right of obliging</hi> is oftentimes lookt upon as exiſting <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>Power of obliging,</hi> but without any ground.</p>
            <p>For, if there be a <hi>God</hi> that will <hi>judge</hi> the Actions of Men, and <hi>give to every one according to his work,</hi> and the Perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Obedience from others are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd by <hi>him</hi> to require it, they have a <hi>Power</hi> as well as a <hi>Right of obliging</hi> them to it, for they have a <hi>Power of propoſing ſuch Motives and Raeſons</hi> for their acting, as are <hi>ſufficient to determine</hi> them to obey ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than diſobey, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments annexed</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or Diſobedience; and conſequently they have a <hi>Power of contributing to their Happineſs or Miſery,</hi> tho' they cannot be the <hi>immediate Inſtruments</hi> of either <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if there be <hi>no God,</hi> then are they <hi>not</hi> commiſſion'd by <hi>him</hi> to command others, but they <hi>uſurp</hi> upon the common Liberty and Equality of Mankind; and, in this cafe they have <hi>no more</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> than they have a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52063:58"/>
               <hi>Power of obliging</hi> thoſe whoſe Intereſt it is with reſpect <hi>to this Life</hi> not to obey them; as will more fully appear hereafter, under another Head.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance there is, where the <hi>Power of obliging</hi> is, or may be exerciſed <hi>without the Right,</hi> and that is, when ſome Men by the Advantages of <hi>more Skill</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> than others, <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Authority from God</hi> command their Obedience upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of great Rewards and Puniſhments, in ſuch things where the Perſons ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded are left to their Liberty by God to act either way, as ſhall ſeem beſt, or moſt for their Advantage to them <hi>in this Life:</hi> In which caſe, thoſe that preſcribe ſuch particular Actions to others, have a <hi>Power of obliging</hi> them to obey becauſe they have a <hi>Power of determining</hi> them to <hi>act</hi> by the Conſideration <hi>of greater Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to be obtained, or <hi>Miſery</hi> to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by acting that particular way they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe than would attend the contrary way of acting, but they have <hi>no Right</hi> to uſe this Power, becauſe they are <hi>themſelves</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>greater Obligations, with reſpect to God, not to employ it,</hi> than <hi>thoſe</hi> upon whom it is exerciſed are <hi>with reſpect to them to obey</hi> it: but if there be no <hi>God,</hi> then is their <hi>Power</hi> their <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52063:59"/>
            <p>From all which it follows, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a <hi>Right of obliging</hi> there is a <hi>Power of obliging,</hi> and, where there is an <hi>abſolute uncontroulable Power</hi> of obliging there is, for that very Reaſon, <hi>a Right</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; but where there is a <hi>ſubordinate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Power</hi> of obliging, it may be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>without Right,</hi> that is, <hi>contrary to ſome Obligations</hi> which the Perſons who exerciſe it owe to a <hi>Superiour Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here, by a <hi>Right of obliging</hi> I would be underſtood to mean <hi>a Liberty of offering ſuch Motives and Conſiderations to rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as when duly applied will determine them to act according to them, with the full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their Mind, and make them infallibly approve and be pleaſed with themſelves for ſo doing;</hi> not <hi>a title to order and diſpoſe of them and their Actions by an irreſiſtible: Force, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the free and unlimited Pleaſure of that Being to whom the Title is ſuppoſed to belong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>God</hi> has <hi>ſuch a Right as this</hi> over his <hi>Creatures,</hi> is no part of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry now; but that he has <hi>ſuch a Right</hi> and <hi>Power of obliging</hi> as I have explained, is ſufficiently proved from the neceſſary <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trilutes of God</hi> before ſpecified, and from the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of all <hi>Obligation,</hi> of which I <hi>have</hi> here given a particular account.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:52063:59"/>
            <p>Whether God has a Right and Title to our Obedience upon any other Foundation but that of his Power to <hi>make us happy;</hi> whether 'tis poſſible for Man to act volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily upon any other Reaſon or Motive but that of <hi>his own Happineſs;</hi> and whether <hi>Happineſs</hi> be the <hi>ultimate End</hi> of all our <hi>Actions,</hi> and the <hi>ultimate Ground</hi> of all <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,</hi> or only a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> but <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>inſeparable</hi> Conſideration; if what I have already ſaid upon theſe Matters does not ſatisfy, I ſhall no farther diſpute; becauſe I am very well aſſured that whatever other Grounds or Motives of our Obedience to God may be imagined by ſome who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to act upon more <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>diſintereſſed</hi> Principles than that of their own Happineſs, 'tis impoſſible to perſuade a Man who does not yet believe any Religion at all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come religious, except it can be plainly, or probably at leaſt, made out to him, that he ſhall better his Condition by it. This I am ſure is the only Argument that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon an Unbeliever to <hi>embrace Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and I ſirmly believe whoever fairly conſults himſelf, will find that he neither <hi>does</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> act upon any <hi>other</hi> ground, 'Tis true indeed, we often act without knowing or conſidering what the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52063:60"/>will be, and we are made and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed after ſuch a manner, that we readily acknowledge our ſelves obliged to ſubmit to the Will and Commands of God <hi>without any expreſs Conſideration of future Happineſs</hi> to be obtained by our Obedience; but if it could be evidently prov'd to us that <hi>Miſery</hi> would be the <hi>certain Conſequence</hi> of thoſe Actions we thought our ſelves upon the firſt View obliged to, we ſhould then be forced to acknowledge that we were miſtaken in our firſt Judgments, and that it would be more reaſonable to act <hi>another way</hi> which we were aſſured would be <hi>more for our Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things being premiſed, I return to the main Queſtion, Whether we <hi>are actually under any Obligations to God,</hi> or which is the ſame thing in other terms, Whether <hi>there be any ſuch thing as Beligion?</hi> And in this manner I ſhall prove there is.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew that there is <hi>ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of acting,</hi> ſuch <hi>a courſe of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Model of living,</hi> which whoever duly and fairly reflects upon, will be <hi>forced to acknowledge</hi> that if he did <hi>live</hi> after That manner he ſhould <hi>approve himſelf</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:52063:60"/>for ſo doing, and if he <hi>lived otherwiſe,</hi> he ſhould <hi>condemn himſelf</hi> for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he that finds himſelf neceſſarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to approve ſuch a particular way of living, and to condemn the contrary, <hi>muſt acknowledge</hi> that he <hi>ought or is obliged to act accordingly.</hi> From whence I ſhall draw this Inference, that therefore all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it muſt be <hi>more for his Happineſs</hi> to act this way than any other, becauſe were it not, his free unbiaſſed Judgment could not, upon a fair Ballance of all the ſeveral Reaſons and Motives of Action, approve him when he did ſo act, and condemn him when he did not; there being nothing elſe but the <hi>different Motives of Happineſs and Miſery</hi> that can determine the Mind to theſe different Acts: And from thence it follows, that he <hi>is truly and really obliged to act</hi> as he <hi>judges he ought to act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove that <hi>God,</hi> who was the Author of our Being, <hi>gave us ſuch a Nature,</hi> by which we are neceflarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to judge after this manner, with <hi>that End and Deſign</hi> that we ſhould exerciſe and employ thoſe <hi>other Faculties</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> he has furniſh'd us with ſuitably hereunto; and that conſequently, what <hi>our Reaſon</hi> tells
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52063:61"/>us <hi>ought to be done,</hi> we are <hi>commanded by God</hi> to do; that 'tis <hi>God</hi> who <hi>propoſes thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> which <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> us to act, and <hi>gives</hi> them all the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> they have over us; and therefore, what <hi>God</hi> has made to appear <hi>reaſonable</hi> or <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to us to do, will accordingly conduce to our <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſgry,</hi> and upon that account <hi>oblige</hi> us to <hi>act</hi> or not to <hi>act.</hi> And farther, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew under this Head, that God purpoſely created us after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with a Deſign to oblige us to ſuch and ſuch Performances, not only from the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſideration of the Make and Nature of Man,</hi> but from <hi>many other Tokens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications</hi> of ſuch an End or Deſign plainly viſible in the <hi>World.</hi> And the <hi>Sum</hi> of what we are thus <hi>obliged to by God,</hi> is what we call our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall <hi>poſitively</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> prove from the <hi>Nature of Religion it ſelf,</hi> that a <hi>regular Practice of all thoſe Duties or Obligations</hi> of which it conſiſts would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conduce to the <hi>greatest Happineſs</hi> Man is capable of, conſidered only in <hi>his preſent Condition,</hi> as included within the Bounds of <hi>this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:52063:61"/>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall ſhew that the <hi>Defect of ſuch a Practice,</hi> and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of it, do neceſſarily lead us to the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a <hi>future State,</hi> as is ſufficient to determine us to prefer one particular way of acting before another, upon <hi>ſuch Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Motives.</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch Degrees of Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> as we are ſure <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more powerful</hi> cannot be offered to us.</p>
            <p>From all which Conſiderations, the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> will be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully evinced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, I am to ſhew that there is <hi>one particular way of acting</hi> which we are <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to <hi>prefer</hi> to <hi>any other;</hi> ſo that, upon a clear and impartial View of pure natural Reaſon, we cannot but <hi>like, approve,</hi> or <hi>be pleaſed with</hi> this way of acting, and <hi>diſlike, condemn,</hi> or be <hi>diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> with <hi>the contrary;</hi> and farther, that we <hi>muſt judge</hi> or acknowledge that what we thus like or approve we <hi>ought</hi> or are <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do,</hi> and what we diſlike or condemn we <hi>ought</hi> or are <hi>obliged not to do;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that we are <hi>really obliged to act</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52063:62"/>to ſuch Judgments, becauſe it muſt be <hi>more for our Happineſs</hi> ſo to act.</p>
            <p>That there are ſome <hi>natural Notions</hi> of <hi>Good and Evil, Right and Wrong,</hi> or ſome ſuch <hi>certain Diſtinctions founded in</hi> or <hi>reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from</hi> the <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of things, as cannot be altered or deſtroyed by any arbitrary Agreement or Inſtitution whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and that theſe are perceivable by the <hi>bare uſe of our Reaſon</hi> the ſame way that any other part of our Knowledge is, are Truths which the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>wiſest part</hi> of Mankind have conſtantly owned, however they may have differ'd in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>which they were,</hi> and <hi>what were the true Grounds and Foundations</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Now, to put theſe Matters beyond all reaſonable doubt, and to cut off all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Conteſt concerning them, I only deſire this may be granted me, that there are ſome things ſo <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>fully</hi> propoſed to the Mind, that a Man cannot <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>with-hold</hi> his <hi>Aſſent</hi> to them, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this happens, there is the <hi>greateſt Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> we are capable of: This being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it neceſſarily follows that we may be as certain that ſuch or ſuch Things <hi>ought</hi> or <hi>ought not to be done,</hi> as that ſuch or ſuch
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52063:62"/>Things <hi>are</hi> or <hi>are not</hi> after this or that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or are <hi>ſo and ſo related to one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Example: I may be as fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I <hi>ought</hi> to deſire and endeavour after my own Happineſs, and that I <hi>ought</hi> not to take away the Happineſs of another Man, when I know I ſhall not add to my own by it, as I can be of the <hi>Truth</hi> of theſe Propoſitions; that <hi>every thing that moves is;</hi> that 'tis impoſſible <hi>the ſame thing ſhould exiſt and not exiſt at the ſame time;</hi> that is, in both theſe Inſtances the things aſſented to have the <hi>ſame Suitableneſs</hi> or <hi>Agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>ſame Force</hi> or <hi>Violence</hi> would be offered to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings by a Denial of either: Which is all the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Certainty</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable by us.</p>
            <p>Several <hi>other moral Propoſitions</hi> might be brought, or deduced from <hi>theſe,</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an <hi>irreſiſtible Conviction</hi> along with them, not to be over-ruled by any after Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: But the <hi>common Rules</hi> and <hi>Maxims of Morality</hi> which are look'd upon as <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> are not <hi>ſo general</hi> as <hi>thoſe</hi> before inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, nor have in all reſpects the <hi>ſame degree of Certainty</hi> belonging to them; but what they are, how they are known, and how far they partake of <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:52063:63"/>I ſhall now give a ſhort Account, and from thence prove that we are <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to <hi>aſſent</hi> to and <hi>approve theſe alſo,</hi> and to <hi>condemn</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>contrary</hi> of them; and conſequently, that we have all the Reaſon in the World to believe it will conduce more to our Happineſs to act up to theſe Principles, than to purſue a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe of Life.</p>
            <p>The <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>moſt general</hi> moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties commonly inſtanced in, are ſuch as theſe, That <hi>God is to be worſhipped,</hi> that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are to be obeyed,</hi> and <hi>all other natural and civil Relations proportionably to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi> that <hi>we ought to abſtain from all ſorts of Intemperance and Exceſs,</hi> and <hi>provide all things neceſſary for the continuance of our Life;</hi> that <hi>we ſhould not do any other man an Injury, but contribute all we can to the Happineſs of Mankind, and more particularly that Society we are of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe, and ſuch like Propoſitions as theſe, are <hi>known</hi> or <hi>found out</hi> by <hi>the Uſe</hi> and <hi>Employment of our natural Faculties</hi> the ſame way that all other Truths are; that is, Men are <hi>taught</hi> or made to have the <hi>Ideas</hi> theſe Terms belong to, or they <hi>get</hi> them by their <hi>own Obſervation,</hi> and then, by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi> them together, they immediately
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52063:63"/>acknowledge ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Relation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, without being influenced by <hi>any other Motive</hi> to judge ſo but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the <hi>Things themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Relations</hi> indeed of <hi>moral Ideas,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ideas themſelves,</hi> are <hi>commonly learnt</hi> from others firſt, before Men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of finding them out themſelves; but this is no more an Argument that their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch kind of Propoſitions is only the <hi>Effect of Education,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>meer Prejudice</hi> and no right Judgment, than it would be an Argument to prove that all the <hi>Mathematical Knowledge</hi> a Man has is nothing elſe but a <hi>Set of falſe Notions</hi> thruſt upon his Underſtanding by <hi>Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> becauſe he happen'd to be taught the firſt Grounds and Elements of this Science while he was young, before he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of finding them out by his own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for, when we <hi>afterwards</hi> come to review the <hi>moral Knowledge</hi> we got when we were Children, let us be never ſo jealous over our ſelves, and take all the Care we can to deliver our ſelves from the <hi>Prejudices of Education,</hi> we ſhall ſtill adhere to and be farther ſatisfied of moſt of thoſe Truths we were then taught, as is ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Experience of ſeveral <hi>thus edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:52063:64"/>the Certainty and Impartiality of whoſe Judgment, has been ſtrengthen'd by the joint Aſſent of ſeveral of a <hi>contrary Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, for a farther Illuſtration of this Point, ſhould we ſuppoſe a Perſon <hi>entirely ignorant</hi> of all ſuch Matters, but <hi>capable</hi> of underſtanding them when propoſed, and one of theſe <hi>moral Rules</hi> or <hi>Maxims</hi> ſhould be <hi>barely explained</hi> to him, without any Reaſons offered to <hi>move</hi> or <hi>incline</hi> his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent either way, I believe 'tis very difficult to imagine how <hi>he</hi> could judge otherwiſe than <hi>we</hi> do.</p>
            <p>As for Example: Suppoſe ſuch a Perſon as this was juſtly inform'd concerning <hi>his own Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> and what was meant by <hi>Worſhip</hi> and all the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions contrary to it,</hi> and he was ask'd which he ſhould rather do, <hi>perform ſuch Acts</hi> as would expreſs this Worſhip, or <hi>neglect, ſlight,</hi> and <hi>omit</hi> them, or elſe <hi>ridicule, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,</hi> and <hi>blaſpheme</hi> that Being we call <hi>God:</hi> or ſuppoſe he was told what a <hi>Parent</hi> was, and that <hi>ſuch a Perſon</hi> was <hi>his Parent,</hi> and that he was himſelf ſenſible of a great many Kindneſſes he had received from him, and it was propoſed to him, after a due Explication of what was meant by theſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52063:64"/>things, to <hi>murder</hi> him, <hi>defend</hi> him from ſome imminent Danger without any hazard to himſelf, or <hi>ſtand ſtill</hi> and do neither; who is there that would not believe that in <hi>theſe Caſes,</hi> fairly propoſed and ſtated, ſuch an <hi>unprejudiced</hi> Perſon as this would not chuſe to <hi>worſhip his God</hi> and <hi>defend his Parent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have therefore the <hi>ſame Reaſon</hi> to conclude that <hi>moral Truths</hi> concerning humane Action are <hi>knowable the ſame way</hi> that all <hi>other Truths</hi> are which terminate <hi>in Speculation</hi> only; and that Men know <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> of them according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Capacity</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of thoſe that are employed in theſe Enquiries.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of ſuch Truths as theſe, 'tis, as in all other kind of Knowledge, <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> conſidered are <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to or <hi>farther</hi> from the <hi>firſt general Axioms</hi> or <hi>Rules of Morality,</hi> from whence all the reſt are deduced; ſuch as are thoſe before mention'd of <hi>ſeeking our own Happineſs, and not taking away another Man's when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add any thing to our own by it,</hi> and ſuch as immediately follow from hence, as that <hi>we ought to prefer a greater Good or Pleaſure to a leſs, a leſſer Evil or Pain to a greater,</hi> and the like, the <hi>Evidence</hi> of which is as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52063:65"/>great as of any <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> or <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Axioms whatever.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>other moral Duties</hi> I had occaſion to inſtance in concerning the <hi>Worſhip of God, Obedience to Parents,</hi> &amp;c. which are <hi>leſs general,</hi> have not the <hi>ſame degree of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> becauſe the <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity of the Connexion</hi> of thoſe Actions with our own <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which is the original Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Action and Duty, is not ſo <hi>clearly diſcoverable</hi> that we immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it impoſſible, it ſhould be otherwiſe; but the <hi>Evidence</hi> of ſuch Propoſitions as theſe which I have mention'd before as the <hi>common Principles of Morality</hi> is ſo great, that, when they are fairly offered to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>without any Conſideration of our own Happineſs</hi> being concern'd in them; if this may be ſuppoſed, as in ſeveral Inſtances no doubt it may, in ſuch a caſe I ſay, we <hi>cannot refuſe our Aſſent</hi> to them; and if ſo, there can be no reaſon aſſign'd why we ſhould judge wrong when there is nothing ſuppoſed to determine the Mind either way but the <hi>Nature of the Ideas themſelves</hi> we judge of, and <hi>all Men</hi> in the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances <hi>neceſſarily</hi> judge <hi>the ſame way;</hi> and then it follows, that <hi>theſe moral Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> have the <hi>ſame degree of Evidence</hi> as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52063:65"/>
               <hi>any other</hi> concerning Matters of <hi>meer Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation:</hi> But the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falſhood</hi> of theſe former depending upon their <hi>Connexion with our Happineſs,</hi> the <hi>Evidence</hi> of them, if <hi>true,</hi> muſt be the ſame in proportion with the <hi>Evidence of this Connexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Reaſon we have to conclude that there is a <hi>Connexion</hi> betwixt <hi>ſuch moral Actions</hi> and <hi>our Happineſs</hi> ſo as to be firmly perſuaded that the <hi>Performance of theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which without any <hi>viſible relation to our Happineſs</hi> we <hi>prefer</hi> and <hi>approve,</hi> will be attended with <hi>more Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>leſs Pain</hi> than <hi>ſuch Omiſſions</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>proſpect of Miſery,</hi> we <hi>condemn;</hi> the reaſon, I ſay, we have thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude is this: we find our ſelves under an <hi>abſolutely neceſſity</hi> of <hi>deſiring</hi> and <hi>endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after our own Happineſs</hi> and every thing that we know tends to it, and of <hi>flying</hi> and <hi>avoiding</hi> whatever we apprehend may <hi>leſſen</hi> or <hi>take it away</hi> and put us into a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary State</hi> of <hi>Miſery;</hi> we find alſo, that <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain, Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> are the <hi>only Principles</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the obtaining the one, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other, the <hi>only Ends</hi> of all Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Purſuit; and therefore, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive it poſſible that Beings ſo made,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52063:66"/>of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> as this ſhould be alſo contrived after ſuch a manner as to be <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to <hi>approve thoſe Actions,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> they <hi>ought to do</hi> them, which would tend to their <hi>Miſery,</hi> and to <hi>condemn thoſe Omiſſions</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> that they <hi>ought not</hi> to be guilty of them which would procure their <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Except then it can be proved from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or it is ſome <hi>other way</hi> diſcoverable, that <hi>acting according</hi> to theſe moral Rules will certainly be attended with <hi>more Miſery</hi> or <hi>leſs Happineſs</hi> than <hi>acting againſt them,</hi> the <hi>preſent Approbation</hi> of our Judgment is a ſufficient Argument that they are <hi>true,</hi> and that the <hi>Obſervance of them</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>more</hi> to our <hi>Happineſs</hi> than the <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Violation</hi> of them; and if it is impoſſible to prove the contrary, as I think it is, and will plainly appear hereafter when I come to conſider a <hi>future State,</hi> then are we <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily determin'd</hi> to make <hi>ſuch Judgments</hi> concerning our Actions, as I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; and if we are neceſſarily determin'd to judge thus, we have the <hi>ſame</hi> or <hi>very near</hi> the ſame <hi>Reaſon</hi> to conclude that the <hi>Obſervation of ſuch moral Rules,</hi> or <hi>ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of acting</hi> as our <hi>Reaſon approves</hi> will contribute <hi>more</hi> to our <hi>Happineſs</hi> than <hi>that</hi> it <hi>condemns;</hi> and conſequently that we are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52063:66"/>
               <hi>obliged</hi> ſo to act; as we have to conclude that what we are <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to give or refuſe <hi>our Aſſent to</hi> ſhould be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi> accordingly.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>only Standard</hi> and <hi>Criterion</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> as well as <hi>Truth</hi> being the <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Frame</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution of the Mind,</hi> and the Mind being <hi>as capable</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> as <hi>Truth,</hi> nay, if theſe can be ſeparated, and there is any Precedence of one to the other, being made <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> for <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> there is as <hi>much ground</hi> to ſuppoſe that Men are not deceived when they are <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily determined to Judge</hi> ſuch a thing <hi>ought</hi> or <hi>ought not</hi> to be done, as when they are determined to judge ſuch a thing <hi>is</hi> or <hi>is not;</hi> and if ſo, then conſequently ſuch a thing as they have thus neceſſarily judg'd ought or ought not to be done, will <hi>as certainly</hi> tend to their <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery</hi> accordingly, if they <hi>act</hi> agreeably to the ſeveral Judgments they made; for otherwiſe they would have been deceived in <hi>ſo judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and when the <hi>Mind</hi> is no other way concern'd in <hi>any thing elſe</hi> than as it has a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its ſelf,</hi> and has nothing to do to <hi>know</hi> any further, why ſhould it not judge as truly and certainly of the <hi>Suitableneſs</hi> and <hi>Unſuitableneſs</hi> of <hi>other</hi> things to <hi>its ſelf,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52063:67"/>as of their <hi>Agreement</hi> and <hi>Diſagreement</hi> among <hi>one another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore theſe <hi>general Principles</hi> or <hi>Rules of humane action,</hi> which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lookt upon as the firſt <hi>Foundations</hi> of all <hi>Morality</hi> or <hi>Duty,</hi> are found ſo very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our pureſt and moſt impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that upon a bare propoſal of them, without any <hi>perceivable relation to our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> they <hi>command</hi> our <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and we <hi>cannot but acknowledge</hi> that what we <hi>approve</hi> we <hi>ought to do,</hi> and what we <hi>condemn we ought not to do,</hi> it may, I think, be very fairly inferr'd from hence, that it would conduce <hi>more</hi> to our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to act <hi>according to</hi> them than to act <hi>otherwiſe;</hi> and conſequently, that we are <hi>really</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> obliged, in the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and force of the Word, to a ſtrict and careful Obſervation of theſe Meaſures in the whole Courſe of our Lives.</p>
            <p>From all which it plainly appears, that the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>theſe moral Axioms</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> which I have placed in the <hi>ſecond</hi> rank, falls <hi>very little</hi> ſhort of the Evidence of thoſe <hi>first irreſiſtible Judgments</hi> or rather <hi>Impreſſions</hi> concerning our <hi>own Happineſs</hi> which are inſeparable from our Nature and from our Thoughts; for <hi>theſe</hi> are known
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52063:67"/>
               <hi>in themſelves</hi> by <hi>immediate Intuition</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> way that <hi>thoſe</hi> are; and if <hi>their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> with <hi>our Happineſs,</hi> or with <hi>thoſe firſt Propoſitions</hi> concerning it before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, cannot <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> be ſaid to be known either by <hi>Intuition</hi> or <hi>Demor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> yet that there is ſuch a Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt them, is, in the <hi>higheſt degree that can be, probable,</hi> or what they call <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally evident.</hi> And this is the leaſt that can be inferred from what has been alleged upon this Head: and I am very cautious of laying more ſtreſs upon any Argument than it will unqueſtionably bear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Step I am to make in the Proof of <hi>Religion</hi> is, to ſhew that what our <hi>Reaſon approves</hi> or <hi>condemns,</hi> and tells us we <hi>ought</hi> or <hi>ought not to do,</hi> we are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God</hi> to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>not to do,</hi> who gave us <hi>ſuch a Nature</hi> by which we are <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> and be <hi>affected</hi> after <hi>ſuch a certain manner,</hi> with <hi>that End</hi> and Deſign that we ſhould <hi>act accordingly,</hi> of which <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> he has given us ſeveral <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi> and <hi>Indications:</hi> which is a farther Confirmation that 'tis <hi>more for our Happineſs to obſerve</hi> theſe Meaſures <hi>of acting</hi> than <hi>not;</hi> and conſequently, that <hi>we are obliged by God</hi> to obſerve them.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52063:68"/>
            <p>That we received our <hi>Beings,</hi> together with all the <hi>Powers, Capacities,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe belongs to them, from <hi>God,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident from the Account before given of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and is a Truth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident with that of <hi>our Exiſtence;</hi> and therefore, when we are <hi>neceſſarily determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> or <hi>be affected</hi> after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that 'tis plainly out of our Power to judge or be affected otherwiſe, we muſt conclude that ſuch a <hi>Determination</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our very <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Make,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is the <hi>Work of God;</hi> who, being an <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Being, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to order every thing he makes to ſome <hi>End;</hi> and there being no End he can be ſuppoſed to deſign any thing for but that which it is capable of, and which it is peculiarly fitted to attain, what Reaſon can be given why we ſhould be <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>ſuch Actions,</hi> and <hi>peculiarly diſpoſed</hi> to them by a <hi>neceſſary Approbation</hi> of them, if it was not <hi>deſigned</hi> by <hi>God</hi> we ſhould <hi>act</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly?</p>
            <p>And farther, Since by our very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> we find our ſelves <hi>invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly determined</hi> to ſeek and endeavour after Happineſs, and avoid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52063:68"/>we have all the reaſon in the World to conclude, that <hi>Happineſs</hi> is the <hi>ultimate End</hi> of our Being and all our Actions; and therefore, the <hi>ſame God</hi> who made us after this manner, having made it alſo neceſſary for us to approve ſuch Actions and judge them fit to be done, and to condemn others as not fit to be done, we cannot conceive it <hi>poſſible</hi> that he ſhould <hi>make it neceſſary</hi> for us to <hi>aim at Happineſs</hi> in all we do, and <hi>likewiſe make it neceſſary</hi> for us to <hi>approve</hi> ſuch Actions, and <hi>judge our ſelves obliged to do</hi> them as <hi>would not</hi> tend to our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> for this is to <hi>deſign</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> us to a certain <hi>End,</hi> and at the ſame time to <hi>make it neceſſary</hi> for us to <hi>prefer</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> ſuch <hi>means</hi> as are <hi>contrary to it,</hi> and to <hi>condemn</hi> ſuch as would <hi>lead</hi> us thither; which is a perfect Contradiction to a wiſe Being, and <hi>cannot</hi> be ſuppoſed of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore we have reaſon to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to the Excluſion of all Doubt, from the <hi>Natures</hi> of <hi>our ſelves</hi> and <hi>other things,</hi> that, what we are neceſſarily determined to judge <hi>is</hi> or <hi>is not, ought</hi> or <hi>ought not to be done,</hi> muſt be in the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality of things</hi> according as we have judg'd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, becauſe it is impoſſible to conceive we ſhould be <hi>ſo diſpoſed</hi> with relation to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52063:69"/>
               <hi>other Beings</hi> and <hi>our own Happineſs,</hi> as to be under a <hi>neceſſity of being miſtaken</hi> in the <hi>cleareſt</hi> and <hi>moſt immediate Perceptions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning either we are capable of; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when we conſider our ſelves and all other Beings as <hi>made</hi> and <hi>contrived</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> this great Truth being allowed, we are <hi>farther</hi> and <hi>more directly</hi> convinc'd of all other Truths we find our ſelves neceſſarily determined to aſſent to; the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> being a full and expreſs Warrant to us that we <hi>cannot be deceived</hi> by <hi>him,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that we <hi>are not miſtaken</hi> in any of thoſe Judgments which <hi>we are neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> to make, becauſe 'tis <hi>God</hi> that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines</hi> us.</p>
            <p>But if any Suſpicion of a Miſtake could be entertained, there ſeems to be leſs ground for it in thoſe Judgments in which <hi>our Happineſs</hi> is <hi>immediately</hi> concern'd than in the Judgments we make upon things that have <hi>no relation to us;</hi> for 'tis more reaſonable to think <hi>God</hi> ſhould make us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a manner that 'twas <hi>neceſſary</hi> for us to <hi>judge wrong</hi> in Matters, where the Conſequences would be the ſame to us whether we <hi>judg'd right</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> or were <hi>wholly ignorant of them,</hi> than to imagine that he ſhould <hi>purpoſely determine</hi> us to judge
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52063:69"/>wrong where <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> depend upon our Judgment.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that <hi>God</hi> did <hi>deſign</hi> to oblige us to ſuch a particular way of acting or living, from the <hi>general Conſideration of the Nature of Man,</hi> whereby he is <hi>neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to approve</hi> ſome Actions and to <hi>condemn</hi> others, and to judge thus of himſelf that he <hi>ought to do</hi> what he ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and that <hi>he ought not to do</hi> what he condemns: and therefore we are <hi>obliged</hi> to obey the <hi>Commands of God</hi> and <hi>our Nature,</hi> and purſue our own Happineſs by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections God has given us, and in the Way and Method he has pointed out to us.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the expreſs Judgment of our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which he has ſet as a certain unerring Guide to lead us to Him and Happineſs, he has given us ſeveral <hi>other Tokens and Indications</hi> of his Deſign and our Duty, both in the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of our <hi>Minds,</hi> and in the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> and <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of <hi>Humane Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, as to the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Mind;</hi> he has not only given us ſuch <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> whereby we are enabled to know and perform ſuch Actions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52063:70"/>as he requires of us, but he has made us ſenſible of all our Obligations by giving us ſuch <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Propenſions</hi> to thoſe particular Actions he has deſign'd to oblige us to, that, as ſoon as ever any Occaſion offers it ſelf, we immediately cloſe with it, ſo that the Action prevents all the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our Reaſon, or at leaſt is ſo quick, that we are not ſenſible of any antecedent Judgment or Deliberation concerning it.</p>
            <p>Thus upon the receipt of any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Kindneſs, we preſently find our Souls <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to all the Acts of Love and Eſteem we are capable of; and, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering</hi> that this is a likely way of procuring more Advantage to our ſelves by engaging the good Opinion of all that are Witneſſes of thoſe Returns we make, we <hi>immediately</hi> break out into all the external Actions that are any ways expreſſive of a grateful Senſe of Mind. So, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when by Reaſoning, Information, or any viſible Indications of Power, we are induced to believe that ſuch or ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is able, at his Pleaſure, to contribute very much to our well or ill Being. Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Miſery, as ſoon as ever we are ſatisfied of this, we are <hi>immediately conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> of all thoſe different Sentiments of Love
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52063:70"/>Fear, and Reverence, and a Diſpoſition to do what we think moſt agreeable to the Will of ſuch a Being; and our outward Behaviour is ſuitable to theſe inward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents <hi>without any expreſs Conſideration</hi> that we ſhall thereby recommend our ſelves to this Being, and diſpoſe him to make uſe of his Power in our Favour only, and not to our Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis plain, that in both theſe Caſes our Actions are not the <hi>Effects of pure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only,</hi> tho' upon Examination they are found to be exactly <hi>agreeable to it;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that upon the ſtricteſt Obſervation of what paſſes within us, we are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in theſe Inſtances of thoſe Steps and Degrees which we are conſcious of in all manner of <hi>reaſoning,</hi> and which diſtinguiſh this Operation of the Soul both from <hi>Intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition</hi> and <hi>Senſation;</hi> nor do by <hi>Intuition</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>immediate Connexion</hi> betwixt <hi>theſe Actions</hi> and <hi>our own Happineſs;</hi> beſides all this, I ſay, if we acted by <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only,</hi> what need would there be of thoſe <hi>previous Sentiments</hi> we feel? We might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the <hi>outward Actions</hi> upon a <hi>bare ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Proſpect</hi> of the Advantages we were likely to procure to our ſelves by them: but, if we look into our ſelves, we ſhall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52063:71"/>be convinced that we <hi>cannot help having</hi> thoſe <hi>Sentiments</hi> we feel upon ſuch Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we do <hi>not reaſon</hi> our ſelves into them, and, if by the Unhappineſs of our Temper, or any other way, we ſhould want theſe Sentiments of Gratitude, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, or the like, we ſhould find ſome difficulty in reaſoning our ſelves into the <hi>ſame outward Behaviour</hi> as would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, if we had been <hi>ſo affected;</hi> and, tho' we were never ſo well convinced that <hi>our Happineſs</hi> was really concern'd in ſuch a Behaviour, all our Actions would come <hi>ſlower,</hi> be performed with <hi>more Conſtraint,</hi> and <hi>leſs Conformity</hi> to one another, than if they had proceeded from a <hi>lively natural Senſe,</hi> till <hi>Habit,</hi> which is another additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal help to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> had given us greater Eaſe and Diſpatch.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſhould find our ſelves <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally made</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> with reſpect to all the <hi>general Duties</hi> of <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> if we entred upon a particular Examination of our <hi>whole Frame</hi> and Conſtitution: from whence we may conclude, that theſe <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>original Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Propenſions</hi> to ſome Actions, and <hi>Reſtraints from</hi> and <hi>Averſions to others,</hi> which we <hi>feel</hi> in our ſelves without being conſcious of any <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52063:71"/>Deliberation</hi> concerning the <hi>Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of what we do, or, after Judgments of this Nature made, we look upon as certain <hi>Motions</hi> of the Soul carrying us on to act according to ſuch Judgments with more <hi>Eaſe, Quickneſs,</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> than we ſhould have done upon the <hi>bare Conviction of our Reaſon</hi> without them: All theſe <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> I ſay, and <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the Soul being <hi>given us by God,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſting us conformably</hi> to the Dictates of our <hi>Reaſon</hi> in diſcharging what we call the <hi>Duties of Religion,</hi> we have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cauſe from hence to conclude, that <hi>God</hi> did <hi>deſign</hi> us for the <hi>Practice of ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and conſequently, that an <hi>obedient Compliance</hi> with this Deſign will contribute <hi>more</hi> to our <hi>Happineſs</hi> than our <hi>Diſobedience</hi> can; which is a <hi>farther</hi> Proof that <hi>we are actually under Obligations to God,</hi> or that <hi>there really is ſuch a thing as Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which <hi>Obligations,</hi> together with <hi>God's Right of obliging,</hi> we are conſtantly put in mind of by the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> and the ſeveral Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>different kinds</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to be found in the World, are the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52063:72"/>
               <hi>chiefeſt Marks</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> by which Men are diſtinguiſh'd from one another in <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> theſe take up a large ſhare in their Thoughts and Diſcourſes, and a great part of their Actions are influenc'd and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Notions and Opinions they have of them; all which do lead us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we are under <hi>higher Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Obedience to <hi>God</hi> than we can be to any <hi>humane Governour</hi> whatſoever; for, whether we conſider our ſelves as <hi>Servants, Children,</hi> or <hi>Subjects,</hi> or any other way <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> to others, whatever Reaſons we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for <hi>our Duty</hi> and Obedience to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Parents,</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi> or for <hi>their Right of commanding us,</hi> they will conclude <hi>more ſtrongly</hi> upon us when we conſider our ſelves <hi>with relation to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> of our <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> and of <hi>their right of obliging</hi> us, are <hi>Power Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> When a perſon has a <hi>Power</hi> of contributing to my <hi>Happineſs or Miſery,</hi> and I do, ſome way or other, <hi>belong to</hi> him, ſo as to be call'd <hi>his,</hi> I look upon my ſelf as <hi>obliged to obey</hi> him or act according to his Will; and if, beſides his having this <hi>Power and Property,</hi> I conſider him as <hi>more inclinable</hi> to do me <hi>good</hi> than <hi>ill,</hi> I conceive my ſelf under

               <hi>higher Obligations</hi> of Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>God</hi> has <hi>all theſe Titles</hi> to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the <hi>higheſt degree poſſible,</hi> for, by giving us our intire Being and every thing that belongs to our Nature, 'tis plain that he has not only a <hi>greater Power of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our Happineſs</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> than any man can have, but alſo a <hi>greater Property</hi> in us by this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> or <hi>Production</hi> than can accrue to any Man by <hi>Conqueſt Purchaſe, Covenant, Generation,</hi> or any other way whereby Men come to have a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> in one another. And that he has <hi>more Goodneſs</hi> towards us, or is <hi>more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> to contribute to our <hi>Happineſs</hi> than <hi>Miſery,</hi> is manifeſt from his <hi>own Nature enjoying Happineſs,</hi> and that other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of it, his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in deſigning every thing for the beſt Ends they are capable of, as alſo from the <hi>Benefits</hi> we have already received from him.</p>
            <p>The inference I draw him from hence is, that, as <hi>our Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> which tell us what ought or ought not to be done, and <hi>natural Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Averſions</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or ſeconding our Reaſon, but always conformably to it, which diſpoſe us to action, were given us by God with a deſign of engaging us to act accordingly,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52063:73"/>ſo were we put into ſuch a <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> with regard to one another, that the neceſſary Relations reſulting from Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety might put us in mind of our relation to God, and the proper peculiar Actions conſequent upon it; ſo that by a <hi>conſtant traditional Education</hi> in the exerciſe of theſe Duties of Subjection of different ſorts <hi>to one another,</hi> we ſhould be led to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our Obligations <hi>to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Being</hi> more eaſily than if every Man had been left to himſelf to find them out by the uſe of <hi>his own Faculties only,</hi> without theſe particular <hi>Occaſions</hi> of ſetting his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> on work.</p>
            <p>All which Conſiderations concerning the <hi>State of humane Nature</hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> are at leaſt <hi>very probable</hi> Arguments that we are <hi>actually obliged</hi> by God to ſuch a particular way of living as we call <hi>Religion;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, we have Reaſon to conclude that a careful <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> all things conſidered, will contribute <hi>more</hi> to our <hi>Happineſs</hi> than a <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of it, becauſe the ſame God who deſigns us for <hi>Happineſs</hi> deſigns us alſo for the <hi>Practice of the Duties of Religion,</hi> tho' we do not yet perceive an <hi>immediate Connexion</hi> betwixt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Happineſs;</hi> which is the next thing to be proved.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:52063:73"/>3. In the third place then I ſhall give ſome <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> Proof from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Religion it ſelf,</hi> that a <hi>regular Practice</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> or <hi>Obligations</hi> of which it conſiſts would certainly conduce to the <hi>greateſt Happineſs</hi> Man is capable of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only in his <hi>preſent Condition,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the Bounds of <hi>this</hi> Life.</p>
            <p>'Tis plainly percieved upon a ſhort tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient View and Compariſon of the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine natures</hi> that <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>made</hi> and <hi>deſigned by God</hi> for <hi>Happineſs;</hi> and we are more nearly and neceſſarily convinc'd by the <hi>irreſiſtible Deſires of Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>Averſions to Miſery</hi> we Experience in our ſelves, and by our <hi>conſtant unalterable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours</hi> to attain the one and avoid the other, that <hi>the Enjoyment</hi> of the pureſt moſt unallayed <hi>Happineſs</hi> we are capable of muſt be the <hi>ultimate End</hi> of our <hi>Being</hi> and all <hi>our actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore <hi>God</hi> has <hi>made us capable of,</hi> and <hi>deſigned us for</hi> ſuch an <hi>End,</hi> and we <hi>find our ſelves neceſſarily determined to aim</hi> at this End; ſince the only way of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this End is by <hi>our Actions,</hi> and we are aſſured by Experience that all our Actions
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52063:74"/>do not lead to this End, but <hi>Miſery</hi> as well as <hi>Happineſs</hi> may be the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> of our Actions, it follows from hence, that there muſt be <hi>one particular way of acting,</hi> which, if ſteadily purſued, will certainly procure us <hi>greater Happineſs</hi> than we can poſſibly attain by <hi>any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther, if we are <hi>deſigned for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> and this Happineſs be attainable only by one particular way of acting, 'tis certain that the ſame God who deſigned us for ſuch an End muſt deſign alſo that we ſhould <hi>act ſuch a particular way</hi> as would conduct us thither.</p>
            <p>In Conformity to which Deſigns, we cannot but believe that, as he has given us a <hi>certain Knowledge</hi> of and <hi>neceſſary Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations toward</hi> our <hi>End,</hi> he muſt have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us alſo <hi>ſufficient Tokens</hi> and <hi>Indications</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> that lead to it; and, upon Examination we are ſatisfied that he has ſo, <hi>by framing our Minds after ſuch a manner</hi> that we are neceſſarily determined to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſome Actions and to condemn others, and to judge our ſelves obliged to do what we approve, and to avoid what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; by <hi>giving us ſuch natural Propenſions and Averſions</hi> agreeable to the Judgments of our Reaſon, as by a ſudden and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52063:74"/>Influence diſpoſe us to, and aſſiſt us in the Performance of the ſame Actions which Reaſon preſcribes; and by <hi>putting us into ſuch a ſtate or condition of Life</hi> with reſpect to one another, where the different kinds of Government and Subjection, and the Notions and Actions reſulting from thence unavoidably lead us to the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of God's Superiority, Power, and Right of obliging, and the Neceſſity of our Obedience to him, in all the ſeveral Inſtances of Duty, in which we conceive our ſelves bound to any governing Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Men, but in a higher and more exalted manner, as becomes the mighty Inequality between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we are farther led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>all other Duties</hi> and Obligations we apprehend our ſelves under, with reſpect to <hi>our ſelves</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> are the Effect of our <hi>Obligation to God</hi> the <hi>Supreme Governour of the World,</hi> whoſe <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> are over <hi>all things, original</hi> and <hi>independent,</hi> and all <hi>other Powers</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> are <hi>derived from</hi> and <hi>dependent upon</hi> him; the Senſe of which Obligation makes all our Actions that are duely influenced by it termed <hi>Religious,</hi> tho' <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>immediate Object</hi> of them.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:52063:75"/>
            <p>And theſe are ſufficient Marks and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to aſſure us that <hi>God</hi> does <hi>require</hi> us to act ſuch a particular way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that we <hi>are actually obliged</hi> to frame our Lives according to thoſe Rules and Meaſures which come under the Name of <hi>Religion,</hi> unleſs it can be ſhewn from <hi>more certain Diſcoveries</hi> of the <hi>Nature of Man</hi> and the <hi>Deſign of God,</hi> that notwithſtanding all theſe fair Appearances, <hi>Religion</hi> is not the <hi>Way to Happineſs.</hi> But, as 'tis manifeſt from what we have already obſerved of the <hi>Nature of God</hi> and <hi>our own Frame</hi> and Conſtitution, that no higher Aſſurances can be given us of the Truth of any thing than we have had in this matter from a Concurrence of our <hi>Reaſon, natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> and <hi>external Condition,</hi> and that we cannot be deceived in aſſenting to ſuch Teſtimony; ſo, upon farther Experiences and Obſerxations taken from our ſelves and the State of Mankind with relation to Religion, we ſhall find that <hi>Religion</hi> is in <hi>its own Nature</hi> ſo <hi>ſuted</hi> and <hi>ſuited</hi> to the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> ſo <hi>propertion'd</hi> to the <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Deſires of the Soul,</hi> as by a <hi>proper Tendency</hi> aad <hi>Eſicacy</hi> to <hi>promote his Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52063:75"/>
            <p>This appears firſt by what we feel in our ſelves. What juſt and impartial <hi>Reaſon approves</hi> we find a <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in approving; <hi>Inclination</hi> ſuperadded to Judgment <hi>height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> the pleaſing Sentiment; <hi>acting</hi> what <hi>Nature inclines to</hi> and <hi>Reaſon warrants,</hi> is accompanied with a new and higher Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, all which we repeat and enjoy over again upon <hi>Reflexion.</hi> And, if any <hi>Pain</hi> or <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> mixes with the Pleaſure, or attends it, that does not ariſe from the <hi>ſame Thoughts</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> that this does, but from a <hi>contrary Application of Mind</hi> in our ſelves or others, which oppoſes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in the Practice of Religion, or from ſome other <hi>extrinſical Caeuſe</hi> that has no Dependance upon or Connexion with Religion; ſo that the <hi>due Performance</hi> of any Religious Action is never <hi>properly</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of any <hi>Pain</hi> or <hi>Trouble</hi> to him that performs it, however in ſome Inſtances it may ſeem to be the Occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>But, in order to be farther ſatisfied of the <hi>natural Connexion</hi> betwixt <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and that we may more clearly perceive that the latter is the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Effect of the former, we ſhould take off our Thoughts from the <hi>preſent State of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52063:76"/>Mankind,</hi> and repreſent to our ſelves <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generation</hi> of Men. living together in a <hi>conſtant regular Obſervance</hi> of <hi>all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Obligations</hi> of Religion: for there we ſhould behold ſuch a glorious Scene of Happineſs riſing before us, that, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>neceſſary Circumſtances of our mortal Condition,</hi> we could not poſſibly imagine or form an Idea of any thing <hi>in this Life</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it.</p>
            <p>This would be a State of <hi>univerſal Peace, Safety, Tranquility,</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> where there would be no <hi>Injuries</hi> nor <hi>Tears,</hi> no <hi>Envy</hi> nor <hi>Diſtruſt;</hi> where every Man would find all the Pleaſures of Friendſhip in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of every Man, and feel his own agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Thoughts towards others redoubled by knowing that they had all the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents for him: In ſuch a State as this all the <hi>natural Appetites</hi> and <hi>Deſires of the Soul</hi> would <hi>be ſatisfied,</hi> without a painful Eagerneſs in the Purſuit, or Satiety in the Enjoyment; and there would be no <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular imaginary Deſires</hi> to create the Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>Diſappointment:</hi> then every Man would be <hi>pleaſed with all he did,</hi> and have his Satisfaction heightned by a full and entire Aſſurance that his Actions were <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the World,</hi> and <hi>acceptable to God.</hi>

            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:52063:76"/>
            <p>Was true <hi>Religion</hi> ſo <hi>univerſally</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly</hi> practiſed among Men, they would engage the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom of the ſupreme Governour</hi> in their Favour by the Honour, Reſpect, and Obedience they paid him; they would be ſure of all the Benefits and Advantages of <hi>humane Strength and Skill</hi> by a mutual Performance of all the Duties of Society; and by an equal regular Conduct and Management of their own particular Capacities and Powers, they would preſerve <hi>themſelves</hi> in the fitteſt and propereſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of enjoying thoſe agreeable Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions God had put within their Reach, and prolong the Enjoyment of them by continuing their Lives to the utmoſt Term they could, by any Endeavours of their own, carry them to.</p>
            <p>Whoever takes a full and diſtinct View of <hi>Religion,</hi> in all its <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Extent,</hi> muſt acknowledge that theſe are the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Effects</hi> of it, where its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is freely diſpenſed, without Check or Oppoſition from contrary Cauſes. And what <hi>greater Happineſs</hi> than this can we, without a <hi>larger Date of preſent Life</hi> or a <hi>proſpect of another,</hi> conceive our ſelves <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of?</hi> or, at leaſt, <hi>is attainable</hi> by any <hi>other Actions</hi> beſides <hi>thoſe of Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:52063:77"/>
            <p>But this, I confeſs, is all but an <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Scene,</hi> a <hi>bare Idea</hi> or Pattern drawn by the Mind, which never was, and perhaps never will be exemplified <hi>in the reality of things:</hi> and therefore it does not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow from hence that, when the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men</hi> act <hi>contrary to Religion,</hi> as now they do, <hi>thoſe</hi> few that are mixt with them, and live <hi>exactly according to the Rules and I recepts of it,</hi> ſhall enjoy more Happineſs than any of the reſt, much leſs <hi>ſuch</hi> whoſe Practice is <hi>inconſtant</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> which is certainly the Caſe of the beſt and moſt careful Obſervers of thoſe meaſures of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Religion preſcribes.</p>
            <p>However, thus much, I think, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inferr'd, That <hi>Religion</hi> is in <hi>its own Nature productive</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> and nothing elſe, and conſequently was <hi>deſign'd</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by God</hi> that it ſhould obtain this Effect.</p>
            <p>From whence I conclude, that if Man was <hi>made</hi> for <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to ſeek it by the <hi>means of Religion,</hi> and theſe means are found to be in <hi>their own Nature ſufficient,</hi> but are ſome way or other, without the Fault of the Perſon that uſes them, <hi>render'd ineffectual for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> from hence, I ſay, we may certainly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52063:77"/>conclude that <hi>God,</hi> who in his great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has order'd all theſe things, did not order them in vain, or with an Intention of deceiving; but has <hi>contrived it ſo,</hi> that <hi>ſome time or other</hi> the <hi>End</hi> to which they all point ſhall be <hi>obtained;</hi> and therefore, if a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> Obſervance of <hi>all</hi> the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion be not attended with a ſuitable Happineſs <hi>in this Life,</hi> 'tis a ſtrong Proof that there will be a <hi>future State,</hi> in which there will be Rewards anſwerable to the higheſt Performances and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>We have Reaſon alſo, from the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, to hope, that the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Endeavours</hi> of thoſe, whoſe Courſe is ſometimes interrupted with voluntary Tranſgreſſions of the Rules preſcribed them, will notwithſtanding, by ſome <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> procure them a <hi>State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi> But this we may be ſure of, that God will put a <hi>mighty Diſtinction</hi> betwixt ſuch as <hi>do but ſometimes</hi> deviate from thoſe <hi>religious meaſures</hi> they have propoſed to themſelves, and thoſe who <hi>conſtantly</hi> act by <hi>different Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Proof of this Concluſion is the fourth thing I propoſed in order to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52063:78"/>Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> Here then I am to ſhew, that the <hi>Defect</hi> of a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> Practice of Religion, and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of this Defect, do neceſſarily lead us to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ſuch <hi>a future State</hi> as is ſufficient to determine us to prefer one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of Life before another, upon ſuch Reaſons and Motives, that is, ſuch degrees of <hi>Happineſs and Miſery,</hi> as we are ſure greater and more powerful cannot be offered to us.</p>
            <p>'Tis very plain, that Religion is not <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> practiſed in the World, nor do the <hi>generality</hi> of any <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of Men make their Duty to God the governing Principle of their Actions. 'Tis manifeſt likewiſe, that <hi>thoſe few</hi> who are <hi>ſenſible of their Obligations,</hi> and endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them, do in many Inſtances <hi>neglect</hi> them, or <hi>act contrary</hi> to them: upon which Accounts it happens, that as there is a great deal more Miſery in the World than our mortal Condition would otherwiſe ſubject us to, ſo it oftentimes falls to the <hi>religious Man's</hi> Lot to have the <hi>greateſt ſhare</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Nor is all the Trouble and Uneaſineſs he ſuffers the Effect of <hi>vicious Habits</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52063:78"/>mixing with, and obſtructing the Performance of his Duty, or carrying him to contrary Actions, tho' very much is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Cauſe, but a great many Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Calamities are laid upon him by the Malice and Hatred of wicked Men <hi>purely for his being religious;</hi> ſo that, did he <hi>perfectly</hi> and compleatly fulfil all his Duty to God, there's Reaſon to believe his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> would be proportionably <hi>encreaſed</hi> as far as it was in their Power to do it.</p>
            <p>From whence it plainly follows, that God has provided ſome <hi>other ſtate of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> for ſuch as live <hi>exactly</hi> according to his Purpoſe and Intention <hi>here;</hi> which will be ſo full and ſufficient a Recompence for all the Miſery they have ſuffered in this Life, as to juſtify their Obedience to God upon ſuch Terms.</p>
            <p>For, if God <hi>deſign'd Man for Happineſs,</hi> as 'tis certain he did, and <hi>appointed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be the <hi>means</hi> to it, as manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his annexing Pleaſure to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt unmixt practice of it, as well as from ſeveral other Indications, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſuppoſe that God ſhould ſuffer his Ends to be <hi>defeated</hi> after a due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Uſe of the means, by the <hi>derived de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Power</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> of <hi>other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:52063:79"/>and order it ſo, that thoſe who were <hi>moſt diligent and exact</hi> in obſerving the trueſt meaſures of acting, ſhould, <hi>for that very reaſon,</hi> meet with the <hi>leaſt Succeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should we therefore ſuppoſe a <hi>few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly religious</hi> afflicted and tormented by wicked Men barely <hi>upon that account,</hi> as there can be no other, if they are what we ſuppoſe them to be; we muſt then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God has <hi>mighty Bleſſings in ſtore</hi> for them, in compariſon of which their <hi>preſent Sufferings are as nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence alſo we may infer, that thoſe whoſe <hi>ſincere Reſolutions</hi> and <hi>Endeavours</hi> are not attended with <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>univerſal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,</hi> and yet, who are rendred <hi>more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> by the Actions of wicked men than they otherwiſe would have been for the ſake of thoſe degrees of Religion they come up to; 'tis reaſonable, I ſay, to conclude that thoſe will, <hi>ſome time</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> receive <hi>more Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> or <hi>leſs Miſery</hi> than <hi>others</hi> proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the difference of their <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Affliction now:</hi> For, according as they have purſued the Means, ſo will their Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the End be; or, if no Reward be due but to a <hi>full Diſcharge</hi> of all <hi>Obligations,</hi> it cannot be imagin'd that thoſe who have Perform'd ſome part of what they were
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52063:79"/>obliged to, and endeavoured at <hi>general Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> ſhould be puniſhed as high as thoſe who have been guilty of a <hi>greater</hi> or of a <hi>total Neglect, Contempt,</hi> or <hi>Volation</hi> of their Duty.</p>
            <p>However therefore it be as to the <hi>manner of it,</hi> 'tis very agreeable to the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Deſigns of God,</hi> according to all the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he has given to Mankind of them, to make the Condition of thoſe who act by the <hi>Principles of Religion</hi> preferable, to that of others who act by <hi>contrary Meaſures,</hi> which it would not always be, was there no other <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> after <hi>this</hi> is ended.</p>
            <p>From all which it plainly follows that there muſt be a <hi>Future State</hi> in which Men will be diſtinguiſh'd from one another by <hi>different degrees</hi> of <hi>Happineſs and Miſery</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>different regard</hi> they had to <hi>Religion in this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Certainty, of which State we are farther convinced of by the general <hi>Wants, Miſeries,</hi> and <hi>Imperfections</hi> of our preſent Nature, which proceed from ſome Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Diſpoſition within us, contrary to that of Religion; which Principle or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of that <hi>univerſal Wickedneſs</hi> which reigns in the World.</p>

            <p>Did Mankind enjoy all the Happineſs they were otherwiſe capable of in this <hi>mortal Condition,</hi> yet, ſo long as they found in themſelves <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> of <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> unknown degrees of Pleaſure, which from the preſent Frame and Conſtitution of things they had no Hope or Proſpect of, and felt an <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> at the Thoughts of <hi>parting</hi> with thoſe Enjoyments they were <hi>poſſeſs'd of,</hi> by the unalterable Decree of <hi>Death,</hi> which they knew themſelves ſubject to; were they I ſay in ſuch a Condition, they would have great Reaſon from hence to conclude, that God did deſign them for ſome other <hi>more perfect State,</hi> where their <hi>whole Capacities</hi> would be filled, <hi>all their Deſires</hi> ſatisfyed, and <hi>no kind of Pain</hi> or <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> check or allay <hi>the Fullneſs of that joy:</hi> not that they had then any cauſe of Complaint, as if God had not dealt kindly by them, in granting them <hi>leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of Happineſs than what they were <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of;</hi> but becauſe, in ſuch a caſe as is ſuppoſed, their <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> would be given them <hi>in vain;</hi> which does not ſeem conſiſtent with the <hi>Wiſdom of God;</hi> and moreover the <hi>Uneaſineſs of Defining</hi> what was <hi>impoſſible</hi> and the painful <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> of what was <hi>certain,</hi> which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52063:80"/>they would then experience, would appear <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with <hi>God's Deſign of making Man for Happineſs;</hi> and therefore t'would be more agreeable to all the Notions we have of God, and all the Obſervations we have made upon his other Works, to ſuppoſe that, had <hi>this Life</hi> been the Extent of Mans <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> God would not have given him a ſenſe or proſpect of <hi>any other:</hi> upon ſuch a Suppoſition as this 'tis highly rational to think that <hi>conſtant even Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> would have bounded all his Thoughts, that his Soul would always have remained at the <hi>ſame equal Poize,</hi> and that he would have <hi>lived</hi> without <hi>deſiring more than he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,</hi> and <hi>died</hi> without any previous <hi>Fears of looſing that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if there is good ground to believe that there would be a <hi>State of future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> tho' Men <hi>enjoyed all they were capable of here</hi> according to the preſent Circumſtances of their Nature and Condition, becauſe their Happineſs here was not compleat by reaſon of ſome Pain and Uneaſineſs mixt with it, and becauſe their Capacities and Deſires exceeded all their actual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how much more reaſonable is it to make the ſame Concluſion now when we, every way, <hi>fall ſo ſhort of the Happineſs</hi> the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52063:81"/>condition <hi>of this Life</hi> would allow us, as will plainly appear if we compare the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of the World with that Draught and Repreſentation we have before given of Humane Life under a regular Practice of the Duties of Religion.</p>
            <p>We are now not only conſcious in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of larger Capacities, of Happineſs than what we enjoy; but there are ſeveral kinds and degrees of it within our Knowledge and ſeemingly within our Reach and Power, which, with all the Endeavours we can uſe we are not able to attain; and the more Wants we are ſenſible of, and the better and more particularly we know what they are, the ſtronger are our Deſires and the greater the Uneaſineſs of Defeats and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, which Experience aſſuras us, are very frequent; The Satisfactions we meet with are commonly very ſhort and mixed with Pain, and we have a great many other things to fear beſides <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Troubles and <hi>Calamities</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life</hi> are too well known to need being inſiſted upon, and too large a ſubject to be particularly treated of in this place. 'Tis ſufficient to my purpoſe to remark in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral what I think may very ſafely be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, if what falls to every Man's ſhare
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52063:81"/>was fairly computed, the <hi>Miſery</hi> of the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of Mankind would out-weigh their <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>deſign'd</hi> by <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and was ſo framed that he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy compleat Happineſs</hi> in <hi>this Life</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mixture of Uneaſineſs, and yet has <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> of <hi>greater</hi> than he can conceive belonging to his Nature and the neceſſary Circumſtances of it here; and farther if Mankind be now involv'd in ſuch a State or Condition of Life in which they <hi>all actually enjoy much leſs Happineſs</hi> than they find themſelves <hi>by Nature capable of here,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt part of them</hi> have a <hi>larger Share</hi> of the <hi>Troubles</hi> than the <hi>Advantages</hi> of Life; from hence I think it may be truly and certainly inferr'd, that there will be <hi>another State</hi> of <hi>pure compleat Happineſs,</hi> anſwerable at leaſt to the higheſt Notions and Conceptions we are able to frame of it.</p>
            <p>But ſince, as has before been proved, God has not <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>unconditionally</hi> determined <hi>all Men</hi> to be happy, but has made <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> to depend upon our <hi>Actions,</hi> and conſequently has <hi>annex'd Happineſs</hi> to a <hi>particular way of acting,</hi> we have all the Reaſon in the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Happineſs of another State</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52063:82"/>will be the Portion of <hi>thoſe,</hi> and <hi>thoſe only,</hi> who <hi>live according to the Rules of Religion here;</hi> and this, I believe, no body is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to doubt of that owns a <hi>future State,</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſpend no time in an unneceſſary Proof of it.</p>
            <p>And, if there are none to be found that <hi>exactly</hi> diſcharge <hi>all</hi> the Obligations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet 'tis more agreeable to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude that thoſe who <hi>ſincerely endeavour</hi> to do it, ſhall by the eſpecial <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour of God,</hi> in ſome ſuch way or manner as to his Wiſdom ſhall ſeem fit, be rendred <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>future Happineſs,</hi> than to believe that <hi>all Mankind</hi> ſhall be <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and none obtain Happineſs, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the Marks and Indications of the <hi>Deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gn of God</hi> in making Man.</p>
            <p>Granting therefore what I think has been ſufficiently proved under this Head, that there will be <hi>a future State</hi> in which all Men will be <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miſerable,</hi> according as they have behaved themſelves here, with regard to what we call <hi>Religion:</hi> this I ſay being allowed, it manifeſtly follows from hence that it is <hi>more for our Happineſs to act</hi> up to the Rules and Directions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than to purſue any other Meaſures, whatever we ſhould happen to ſuffer in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52063:82"/>this Life for ſo doing; becauſe the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a future State will ſo far outweigh all the ſufferings of this, that when we come to enjoy it we ſhall be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the end and reward of our Labours was very well worth all the Troubles and Difficulties we found in the way to it; and if it be <hi>abſolutely, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the whole extent and duration of our Being,</hi> more for our Happineſs to live Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly than otherwiſe, then are we in the higheſt and ſtricteſt ſenſe <hi>obliged</hi> to live ſo, which was the thing I undertook to prove.</p>
            <p>Nay further, if beſides the <hi>natural Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> which reſults from <hi>Religious Acts</hi> while we are practiſing them here, God has given us a <hi>certain Proſpect</hi> and <hi>well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hope</hi> of a <hi>State,</hi> of <hi>greater Bliſs hereafter,</hi> I dare venture to aſſert that <hi>generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Religion</hi> will prove the <hi>ſureſt way to Happineſs even in this Life;</hi> ſo that, tho' <hi>ſometimes</hi> the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>ſome particular Men</hi> upon that account, may exceed all the noble Satisfactions Religion can afford them here, yet all things conſider'd, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Methods of acting weigh'd together with all the probable Conſequences that, according to the common courſe of things, may attend them, there will be ſufficient
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52063:83"/>reaſon for a wiſe Man to prefer the practiſe of Religious Duties to the ways of Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon the ſcore of the <hi>preſent Happineſs</hi> he is very like to enjoy by that means, reckoning in the <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>proſpect only</hi> and not the <hi>Poſſeſſion of another State:</hi> as will more plainly appear under the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head of Diſcourſe:</p>
            <p>Which is a Proof of <hi>Religion</hi> from a Compariſon of it with <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and the neceſſary Conſequences ariſing from thence.</p>

            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52063:85"/>
            <p n="4">IIII. I have before given a <hi>poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> proof of Religion, from <hi>certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> drawn from the <hi>natures</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> of the <hi>Beings</hi> concerned in it. I ſhall now endeavour to make good the ſame Truth, by ſhewing what <hi>Abſurd</hi> and <hi>Unreaſonable</hi> things would follow from a <hi>denial of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and how <hi>Pernicious</hi> and <hi>Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> to Mankind, the eſtabliſhment of a contrary Belief and Practice would be.</p>
            <p>In the management of which Subject, I ſhall firſt conſider the <hi>ſeveral Steps</hi> and <hi>Degrees of Irreligion,</hi> and then ſhew how far they all lead to the ſame Ends, and what are the peculiar Conſequences of each.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Irreligion,</hi> ſo far as it conſiſts in <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Belief,</hi> is of three Sorts: For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men deny the <hi>being of a God,</hi> and conſequently all Religious Duty falls a courſe by the taking away the Foundation of it; or they acknowledg a God, but deny that <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>any ways Obliged by him, to act</hi> ſuch a particular way as we pretend
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52063:86"/>he is; or elſe they own they are in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances obliged to Worſhip God, and to live according to thoſe rational Principles of Action we have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but do not believe <hi>there is any future State of Rewards and Puniſhments</hi> after this Life.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are very different Notions conſidered barely in themſelves as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Speculation</hi> only; but, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the <hi>practical Effects and Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of them, we ſhall find that they all aim at the <hi>ſame thing</hi> though ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways: which is the eſtabliſhing a <hi>general liberty of Living as every man plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> upon Principles contrary to thoſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>This is plain of the two firſt Opinions, which <hi>take away all manner of Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> and upon ſtrict examination, will be found to be True of the laſt; which ſo far <hi>Looſens</hi> and <hi>Weakens the Influence of Religion,</hi> that it will not be able to bear up againſt the force of contrary Motives to Action.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider theſe Notions apart, and then we ſhall the better perceive what the <hi>direct,</hi> and <hi>immediate Conſequences</hi> of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52063:86"/>
               <hi>each Opinion</hi> are, and how far they <hi>fall in with one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, we will ſuppoſe that there is <hi>no God,</hi> and Conſequently <hi>no Religion:</hi> this being ſuppoſed, what are we to think of <hi>our Selves?</hi> What kind of Beings are we? How came we firſt to <hi>exiſt,</hi> and what are we to <hi>do</hi> while we continue to be?</p>
            <p>That we <hi>are,</hi> and that we <hi>feel our ſelves ſo and ſo Affected</hi> 'tis impoſſible to doubt: and among the ſeveral things that I am <hi>infallibly Conſcious of,</hi> I perceive ſuch an <hi>Agreement</hi> and <hi>Connexion</hi> betwixt <hi>ſome of them,</hi> that, let me do what I can, I <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help</hi> perceiving them as <hi>together:</hi> and ſuch <hi>a diſagrement</hi> betwixt <hi>others,</hi> that I cannot help perceiving them as <hi>aſunder,</hi> or <hi>ſeparate</hi> from one another. Theſe <hi>Complex Perceptions</hi> or <hi>Appearances,</hi> I am aſſured of the ſame way, I am aſſured of my own Being, or any <hi>ſimple Perception</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: but if theſe things, which I <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily perceive</hi> as together or aſunder, and cannot poſſibly perceive otherwiſe, ſhould not be Joyned or Separated accordingly <hi>in the Nature and Reality of things,</hi> but only <hi>in the Mind:</hi> then do I know nothing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52063:87"/>
               <hi>certain</hi> beyond <hi>Appearances</hi> and the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of my own Mind,</hi> and yet am <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly Diſpoſed to believe</hi> what may be <hi>Falſe,</hi> with ſo ſtrong an aſſent, that 'tis the hardeſt thing in the World to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my ſelf to entertain the leaſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of a bare poſſibility of its Falſhood, as any man may experience in himſelf, if he will but try to Doubt of what we call a <hi>ſelf-evident Propoſition;</hi> which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that there are ſo few that pretend to be <hi>thorough Scepticks</hi> if there ever were really any ſuch, which I dare confidently affirm there never were. But if it were poſſible that I could prevail with my Self to <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Being of a God.</hi> after a full and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Conſideration of the Proof before given of this Truth, I do not ſee where my Doubts could ſtop, or what could deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my Aſſent to any thing elſe. <hi>Reaſon, Truth</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> would be bare unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>Sounds,</hi> which would cauſe no other Perceptions in me; my whole Life would be nothing but Suſpence and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; Darkneſs and Ignorance would cover my Underſtanding, and continual Uneaſineſs would ariſe from a reſtleſs Succeſſion of vain undetermin'd Thoughts.</p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:52063:87"/>
            <p>If therefore there <hi>be no God,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thoſe <hi>appearances</hi> of <hi>Evidence</hi> that there is ſuch a Being, we have the ſame Reaſon to diſtruſt <hi>all our other Knowledg.</hi> And a continual deſire of Knowing, with a conſtant agitation of Thoughts in the ſearch or purſuit of Knowledg, joyn'd with a continual diſtruſt of all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Truth, without any manner of Reſt or Acquieſcence, which we ſhould then feel in our Selves, would be ſuch an uneaſie State as no man, I believe, could bear; and, I believe, no man ever yet felt; and yet this would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the denial of a God, ſuppoſing there is the <hi>ſame appearance of Evidence</hi> for his <hi>Being</hi> as we have for <hi>any other Truth,</hi> as thoſe that have fully examined the proofs of it muſt Acknowledg.</p>
            <p>But this perhaps is too much to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it being very eaſie to imagine, that there may be men who deny the <hi>Being of God</hi> and <hi>all manner of Religion,</hi> without diſtruſting their <hi>other Knowledge;</hi> who in all other matters, Argue from the ſame Principles, and Act by the ſame Rules as the reſt of Mankind do. Tis very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that perſons who never gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52063:88"/>the trouble of being acquainted with <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> may think all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations there pretended to falſe, and the whole Science a Cheat, without calling in queſtion any other parts of Knowledge they have happen'd to be converſant in: and much more concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable is it that ſuch as never duly and fairly conſidered the Arguments for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould deny both without diſtruſting their Faculties upon other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; which is certainly the caſe of all that pretend to ſuch a denial.</p>
            <p>Now in applying my ſelf to theſe men, I do not think it ſufficient to alledg that the Proof I have given of theſe great Truths, is <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> drawn from <hi>ſuch Principles</hi> as they own, and make uſe of in other matters, though this may certainly be affirm'd; to alledge this is not ſufficient, becauſe, they may have that eaſie anſwer ready which all people give that are fond of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impatient of enquiry into things they would not have otherwiſe than as they now believe them; thus, I ſay, they would be apt to anſwer; That Arguments drawn out to any length are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52063:88"/>very Uncertain; there may be a Miſtake in ſome part of the Deduction; and <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi> at a great diſtance from their <hi>firſt Principles,</hi> may not have all <hi>their</hi> Force and Strength convey'd to them; and ſo, though the <hi>whole Contexture</hi> of the Proof ſeems ſpecious, there's no reaſon to quit ſuch Opinions they are fully perſwaded of, for others that they certainly perceive to be Falſe, though they are ſet out ſo plauſibly, that they cannot tell how to aſſign the particular Falſhood of them.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Perſons that <hi>deny the Being of God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> are not well acquainted with what they deny; have very imperfect Notions of theſe things, and do not trouble themſelves to look into them, or conſider the Proofs brought for them; but yet are ſuppoſed to underſtand the <hi>contrary Opinions,</hi> which they profeſs to be ſo well perſwaded of, and to act by; it cannot but be very proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them concerning <hi>their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,</hi> and ſuppoſing <hi>their Principles</hi> true, conſider them in their full Extent, and examine into the genuine conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them: and, if when I have given a <hi>true Idea</hi> and <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of <hi>Irreligion,</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52063:89"/>they will own this to be their Faith ſtill, I deſire no better Witneſſes to confirm the Truth of what I have urg'd in the Defence of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſing then that <hi>there is no God nor Religion,</hi> and that we muſt <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>act</hi> as our <hi>Reaſon</hi> preſcribes we ſhould upon ſuch a Suppoſition, theſe two things do <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> follow:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>all Men are equal,</hi> and there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Superiority, Right,</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> of any kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>every Man</hi> is to <hi>act</hi> as <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> ſhall <hi>judge</hi> moſt <hi>convenient</hi> for his <hi>own particular Happinefs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>all Men are equal</hi> is very plain if we conſider the <hi>Original Capacities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of Human Nature, without any external Advantages of <hi>Birth, Education</hi> and <hi>Society:</hi> nor do theſe Differences, without a God, cauſe any ſuch <hi>Inequality</hi> betwixt particular Men, as to make one Man <hi>ſubject</hi> to another, or lay any <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> upon the one to act according to the other's Will.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52063:89"/>
            <p>There needs no further Proof of this but to conſider, That there's no Man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his Circumſtances in the World are, can have ſuch a <hi>certain uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power</hi> over another as to make it <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> for him to approve or prefer ſuch a particular way of acting which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes: For, whatever a Man promiſes or threatens, be it never ſo great in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, may, by ſome ſudden unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Accident, be hindred from taking effect, even in the moment of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; beſides, whatever is promiſed or threatned, being certainly of no longer continuance than Life, be it never ſo great in it ſelf, it may not, oftentimes, countervail ſome other Motive the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus accoſted is govern'd by. There may be ſome particular Enjoyment he is poſſeſs'd of, which his Imagination has ſo heightned, or Habit has made ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to him, that nothing pleaſant or grievous in Life can be of weight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to determine him to a contrary Choice.</p>
            <p>Thus have we ſeen Men of <hi>no Religion</hi> ſacrifice all they had, and bear all that could be inflicted upon them, rather

            <p>From whence it follows, That, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a God,</hi> no Man can have a <hi>true Right of obliging</hi> another; the <hi>Right of obliging</hi> being founded in <hi>ſuch a Power</hi> of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as his <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſubmit to when 'tis made uſe of.</p>
            <p>It may indeed ſo happen, ſometimes, by the favour of particular Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that a Man may propoſe to me to act after ſuch a manner, upon <hi>ſuch proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Motives and Reaſons,</hi> as I may judge it <hi>very likely</hi> that it ſhould conduce <hi>more to my Happineſs</hi> to act <hi>thus</hi> than <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;</hi> but this is not ſufficient to give any particular Man, or kind of Men a <hi>Right</hi> to my Obedience, becauſe I can never be <hi>ſure</hi> of their <hi>Power</hi> of enforcing theſe <hi>Motives:</hi> and therefore, tho I do find the World at preſent ſo conſtituted, that Men of ſuch a <hi>Character</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> have <hi>more probable</hi> Opportunities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to my <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery</hi> than others, I am not to look upon them as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52063:90"/>having any <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> over me; but ſuch whoſe Wills and Counſels I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low oftner than thoſe of others, becauſe I judge it <hi>more for my Intereſt</hi> ſo to do: but when I judge it more for my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſt to follow my <hi>own</hi> or <hi>any other Man's,</hi> then am I <hi>as much obliged</hi> to act accordingly; and in ſuch a caſe, I have <hi>as true a Right of my own,</hi> or the Perſon whoſe Advice I take has <hi>as much Right</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over me as my <hi>Father, Maſter</hi> or <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> and whatever elſe are uſed to imply <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Subjection,</hi> if there be <hi>no God,</hi> are <hi>falſe impoſing Names;</hi> and, if any Advantage has been taken in our Infancy to convey any Notions of <hi>Authority, Duty</hi> or <hi>Obligation</hi> by them, we are to ſhake off <hi>all theſe Prejudices,</hi> as well as <hi>thoſe</hi> concerning <hi>God and Religion,</hi> which have been made uſe of, no doubt, for the better impreſſing and enforeing <hi>theſe</hi> upon us.</p>
            <p>We muſt diſcard likewiſe thoſe other falſe Notions of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property;</hi> by the means of which ſome Men challenge to themſelves larger Shares and Portions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52063:91"/>of the neceſſary Supports and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Life than the reſt of Mankind, for which there is no manner of Ground <hi>in reaſon:</hi> For <hi>all</hi> Men being <hi>equal,</hi> they have <hi>all an equal Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to every Thing they are capable of enjoying or poſſeſſing; nor can any <hi>Priority of Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> any <hi>Pains</hi> or <hi>Labour of Acquiſition,</hi> any <hi>Promiſe, Contract</hi> or <hi>Agreement</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever be ſufficient to <hi>found</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> in any thing to the Excluſion of any other Man: which will appear very plainly if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Conſequence ariſing from the Suppoſition of <hi>no God nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which is this, That <hi>every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man</hi> is to act as <hi>he himſelf</hi> ſhall judge moſt convenient for his <hi>own particular Intereſt or Happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's no other <hi>Principle, Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> of Action imaginable in ſuch a caſe. And, if all Men <hi>do</hi> and <hi>muſt act</hi> according to this <hi>Principle,</hi> they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if they will be conſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>judge</hi> that there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Duty, Right</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> or any thing elſe commonly thought to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52063:91"/>be the <hi>Cauſes of</hi> them, <hi>implied in</hi> them, or to <hi>reſult from</hi> them, that is, That there can be <hi>no Action</hi> of <hi>their own</hi> or <hi>other Mens,</hi> or <hi>any other Circumſtance</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> whatſoever, that can be any bar or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to any Man's Endeavours of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his Condition, or advancing his Happineſs, <hi>when</hi> and in <hi>what manner ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> he ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>Now, that this is <hi>the neceſſary</hi> and <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Principle</hi> ſuch Perſons as deny the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God and Religion</hi> can be influenc'd by in their Actions is very plain, if we conſider theſe two things, which, as has before been ſhewn, <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> aſſure us of:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we are <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily determined</hi> to ſeek and endeavour after our own Happineſs, whether there be a <hi>God</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> or whatever other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That, if <hi>there be no God,</hi> no Man can be conceived to have ſuch a <hi>Preeminence</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> above another, that, if <hi>he</hi> will, <hi>he</hi> can <hi>certainly</hi> contribute ſo far to his Happineſs or Miſery, that it muſt needs be <hi>unavoidably</hi> better for him to act that particular way <hi>he</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52063:92"/>than any other, and that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus <hi>preſcribed to</hi> cannot <hi>poſſibly</hi> help judging ſo.</p>
            <p>And, if no <hi>Man</hi> has ſuch a Power, there are no <hi>other higher Beings</hi> that we know of, or, if there <hi>be,</hi> that, <hi>without a God,</hi> we can imagine ſhould have <hi>greater Power</hi> over us than <hi>one Man</hi> has over <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it follows, That <hi>every Man,</hi> being <hi>neceſſarily determined</hi> to act for his own Happineſs, and <hi>no Man</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Power enough</hi> to make the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of another to him the <hi>certain way</hi> to Happineſs, <hi>no Man</hi> is to <hi>act</hi> according to the Will of <hi>another,</hi> any <hi>further</hi> than he <hi>himſelf judges</hi> he ſhall be the <hi>happier</hi> for ſo acting.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider further how ſmall the <hi>Differences of Power</hi> are among Men, what <hi>reciprocal Advantages</hi> they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one another, how <hi>changeable</hi> all theſe diſtinguiſhing Circumſtances are, and what <hi>different Notions</hi> and <hi>Sentiments</hi> Men have of the <hi>Happineſs of this Life:</hi> If, I ſay, we carefully conſider and weigh all this, we ſhall be ſtill more ſatisfied that there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:52063:92"/>or <hi>Subjection, Obligation, Right</hi> or <hi>Property;</hi> and better perceive the whole Force and Influence of the forementioned Principle of Action.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then Societies eſtabliſh'd as we now find them, and that due Care was taken to perſuade Mankind that there was no ſuch thing as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> ſo that they had throughly worn off <hi>thoſe Notions</hi> and all the <hi>conſequential Prejudices</hi> that attended their former Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and every Man was prepared to act what he judged moſt conducing to his own Happineſs: upon this Suppoſition, I ſay, it muſt needs follow, that a great many Men would find themſelves very uneaſie in the want of ſeveral things which they ſaw others poſſeſs'd of, and in the performance of ſeveral Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the command of others that were free from that Trouble themſelves; and what could hinder or reſtrain ſuch Men from ſeizing upon what they wanted, and freeing themſelves from what was ſo troubleſome to them, but the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of worſting their Condition by a ſucceſsleſs Tryal? But this Thought could not hold them long, becauſe there
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52063:93"/>would be ſo many that found themſelves in theſe Circumſtances that they would ſoon be ſenſible of their Strength, and being enraged at the Unreaſonableneſs of thoſe few, whom they ſaw diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them by ſuch over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Advantages of Life, they would join together in a Deſign of bringing things to a greater <hi>Equality:</hi> And thoſe who had taſted the extraordinary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Government and Exceſs, whoſe Imaginations had been entertain'd with the Pride and Elegance of Living, would endeavour to ſupport the <hi>Difference of their Condition,</hi> and be reſtleſs under the Loſs of it, and employ all their Art and Strength to recover their Ground, and trample upon the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>This would be the Effect of a <hi>full Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment</hi> of <hi>Irreligion</hi> in the World, if we conſider the <hi>prefent State</hi> and <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>all human Societies,</hi> there being no Nation or Society of Men, in which the <hi>far greateſt Part</hi> of the People are not forced to uſe <hi>Abundance of Pains,</hi> and undergo a <hi>great many Troubles and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in <hi>ſupplying their own Wants,</hi> and in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52063:93"/>
               <hi>miniſtring to the Eaſe and Pleaſure of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe Men united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon what Terms or Conditions we pleaſe, however things are divided, if <hi>every Man</hi> be convinc'd that <hi>there is no God nor Religiou,</hi> the <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Miſery of all</hi> will be the <hi>certain Conſequence</hi> of ſuch a Belief. For <hi>every Man</hi> being to act for his <hi>own Happineſs,</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many <hi>ſeveral Notions</hi> of Happineſs as there are <hi>different Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the Soul of Man, all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>different Methods of Purſuit,</hi> 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but Men muſt claſh and interfere one with another, and every one's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs be built upon, or promoted by the Miſery of others; which muſt end in the worſt <hi>State of War</hi> imaginable. When Luſt, Ambition, or Revenge is the ruling Paſſion in a Mans Mind, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from making the Miſery or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a Nation the way to his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if he can do it ſecurely, or judges nothing more terrible than the Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his preſent Condition. And the ſame may be ſaid of any thing elſe that a Man places his chief Happineſs in,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52063:94"/>whatever was the Cauſe of ſuch a Choice.</p>
            <p>All that can be alleged to avoid theſe <hi>dreadful Conſequences</hi> that ſeem to be the <hi>certain immediate Effects</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> is, that the <hi>Advantages</hi> of <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> are ſo very great, and every Man is ſo ſenſible that his own particular Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is included in that of the Publick; that, by virtue of this very Principle, Men will readily agree to obſerve all ſuch things as tend to the <hi>common Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> and Welfare of <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That this indeed is a ſufficient Motive to Perſons who have felt or conſider'd the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Calamities of a State of Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to <hi>enter into</hi> or <hi>continue in</hi> Society, upon ſuch Terms as do <hi>then</hi> ſeem to conduce to their particular Happineſs; but if <hi>afterwards</hi> the <hi>breaking</hi> of any of theſe Terms and Conditions ſhall appear to any of them to contribute <hi>more</hi> to their Happineſs than the <hi>keeping</hi> them, they are <hi>as much oblig'd</hi> to <hi>act contrary</hi> to their <hi>former Promiſe, Contract</hi> or <hi>Agreement,</hi> as they were <hi>at firſt to make it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="167" facs="tcp:52063:94"/>
            <p>And, if we rightly conſider things, we ſhall find, That the <hi>Generality</hi> of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Society</hi> are Men of too narrow and confin'd Underſtandings to perceive all the ill Conſequences, <hi>their particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> have upon <hi>Society:</hi> and, if they have ſome confuſed Notions of them, the Miſchieſs do not appear to them ſo near as to fall in <hi>their Days,</hi> and involve <hi>them,</hi> and they have no concern beyond <hi>their own Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>greateſt part</hi> both of thoſe that are and are not capable of ſuch Judgments and Reflexions are too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with the Senſe of <hi>preſent Good</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to forego the <hi>more certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Gratifications</hi> of their Deſires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>faint Proſpect</hi> of <hi>uncertain Miſchiefs</hi> that may attend them; and which, if they do happen at all, do not ſeem <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>more difficult to bear</hi> than their preſent Self-denial would be.</p>
            <p>He therefore that is a <hi>thorough Atheiſt,</hi> and will purſue his Principles as far as they will carry him, muſt look upon all the Notions of <hi>Government, Right</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> of what kind ſoever they be, with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52063:95"/>all the pretended <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Foundations</hi> of them, and the ſeveral <hi>Relations</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſult from them; either as <hi>falſe Pretences</hi> deviſed by ſome cunning Men, by means of which they would have <hi>others</hi> act under <hi>ſuch and ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> might enjoy <hi>their own Liberty</hi> to more advantage; or as <hi>uſeleſs inſignificant Inventions,</hi> which make no manner of Change in the Conduct of Life, but leave every Man to act the ſame way, as he would do if there were no ſuch Notions or Expreſſions ever heard of:</p>
            <p>He muſt look upon <hi>himſelf</hi> as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge of his own Happineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Chief Governour</hi> and <hi>Director of his own Actions:</hi> and, being fully aſſured that <hi>every Man elſe</hi> is the ſame, with reſpect to <hi>himſelf,</hi> he is not to expect that <hi>any other Man</hi> does or will contribute to <hi>his Happineſs</hi> any further than as he thinks he ſerves <hi>his own Intereſt</hi> by it; nor can <hi>he</hi> conceive a Deſign of contributing to the Happineſs of <hi>another Man,</hi> but upon the <hi>ſame Conſiderations:</hi> And, being well convinc'd of theſe things, and reſolv'd to act accordingly, He muſt examine
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52063:95"/>wherein his <hi>chief Happineſs</hi> conſiſts, and how he may beſt attain it; upon which Enquiry he will find, That he muſt place his Happineſs in the Enjoyment of the <hi>greateſt Pleaſure</hi> he is capable of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>leaſt Allay</hi> or <hi>mixture of Pain.</hi> Now, in purſuing what he <hi>thinks</hi> the greateſt Pleaſure, and avoiding what he judges the greateſt Pain, He muſt <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> or <hi>omit any Action</hi> whatſoever in his power, the Performance or Omiſſion of which he <hi>judges conducive</hi> to <hi>thoſe Ends</hi> he has propoſed to himſelf; and ſo he knows muſt <hi>every other Man</hi> that <hi>acts</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>ſame Principles,</hi> be his Notions of Happineſs or Miſery never ſo different from <hi>his:</hi> upon which account he cannot but acknowledge that <hi>all Actions</hi> are <hi>alike</hi> and <hi>of the ſame Nature,</hi> and that there is no ground for any diſtinction of them into <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>unlawful, juſt</hi> and <hi>unjuſt, vertuous</hi> and <hi>vitious;</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Sort of Action</hi> imaginable, but may contribute indifferently either to the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery</hi> of ſome Man, or to <hi>both,</hi> when, conſider'd with reſpect to <hi>ſeveral Perſons,</hi> or with reſpect to the <hi>ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at ſeveral times,</hi> according to the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52063:96"/>Sentiments</hi> or <hi>other Circumſtances</hi> of thoſe concerned in the Action, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he muſt alſo grant there can be no <hi>certain Rules</hi> or <hi>Principles of Acting,</hi> no <hi>particular Set of Actions</hi> or <hi>Scheme of Life</hi> which will <hi>certainly</hi> procure any Man, that follows it, <hi>more Happineſs</hi> than he could obtain by <hi>any other means;</hi> but the <hi>ſame Man</hi> muſt be obliged often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to act <hi>contrary Ways,</hi> and purſue the <hi>ſame End</hi> by the <hi>moſt oppoſite Methods</hi> imaginable; and, if he is utterly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his Hopes by the interfering Purſuits of others, he muſt <hi>change his chief Pleaſure,</hi> and chuſe a new Object of his Happineſs, or undergo a great deal of Miſery for obſtinately ſticking to his former Choice:</p>
            <p>And further, the Perſon, whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter we are drawing, if he will be true to his own Principles, ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from the Proſecution of his Ends, by any <hi>Concern for the Happineſs of others,</hi> or <hi>Senſe of their Miſery,</hi> or by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Actions and the Meaſures he takes;</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:52063:96"/>
            <p>He is never to prefer the <hi>publick Good</hi> of a <hi>City, Nation</hi> or <hi>Empire</hi> to his <hi>own private Satisfaction,</hi> tho the Duration of it be but a moment, if he cannot be <hi>ſo happy without it: Generoſity, Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> muſt give place when they do not ſerve to promote his Attainment of what appears more agreeable to him than the Exerciſe of ſuch Acts which go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Names; all Sentiments of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Pity</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> are to be laid aſide when the <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Miſeries of others</hi> can procure him what he eſteems a greater Happineſs than the Eaſe of complying with thoſe fooliſh Diſpoſitions of his Nature or Temper, which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all other Inclinations he finds in himſelf, his <hi>Reaſon</hi> tells him are to be bent and directed toward his <hi>chief Happineſs;</hi> which is the <hi>Gratification</hi> of the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> and <hi>moſt vigorous Paſſion</hi> of his Soul, whichſoever it is that happens to be the uppermoſt in his Conſtitution:</p>
            <p>He is to look upon all the Notions of <hi>Praiſe, Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> as <hi>meer empty Names,</hi> when apply'd to any thing but <hi>Cunning</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> in the <hi>managing</hi> and <hi>advancing</hi> a Man's <hi>own Intereſt,</hi> and

            <p>And if God ſhould ſuffer this to be the Reſult of the bold Talk and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>preſent Atheiſts of this Nation;</hi> they would then repent that they did not keep their <hi>Atheiſm to themſelves,</hi> and make their Advantage of <hi>other Peoples Credulity:</hi> For, if <hi>all the People,</hi> or <hi>any conſiderable Number of them</hi> were of their Opinions, they would ſoon overturn <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and bring all things to an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality;</hi> and then farewel to all the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Enjoyments</hi> and <hi>Conveniencies</hi> of Living, when <hi>every Man</hi> muſt <hi>labour</hi> to maintain his <hi>own Life,</hi> and be in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fear</hi> of having it taken away by <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have ſaid of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> is, with very little Difference applicable to all manner of <hi>Deiſm,</hi> which is ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of a <hi>God,</hi> as does not include any Religion in it. For, if the <hi>Deiſt</hi> be of the <hi>Epicurean Sect,</hi> and makes <hi>his God</hi> an <hi>unconcern'd Spectator of Human Actions,</hi> he muſt, as to what concerns his own Conduct, <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>act</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52063:98"/>the <hi>ſame way</hi> that the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> does: For, if <hi>God require nothing</hi> of him, <hi>is not pleaſed</hi> or <hi>offended with any thing</hi> he does, nor has <hi>annex'd</hi> any <hi>Rewards</hi> or <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> ſort of Life, he has <hi>full Liberty</hi> to chuſe for himſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his <hi>own Happineſs</hi> in what way or manner he ſhall think fit; which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the Caſe of the <hi>Atheiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the ſame thing, in effect, with thoſe that make <hi>God</hi> a <hi>neceſſary Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Men neceſſary Agents:</hi> For, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Opinion, <hi>all</hi> Actions are <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> as being <hi>equally neceſſary,</hi> and all Men muſt obey <hi>their own Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and there can be <hi>no general Rules</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> for Men to act by; there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Obligation, Reward</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> nor have any of <hi>thoſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> taken away by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> any place or foundation under <hi>this Hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Perſuaſion of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a <hi>God,</hi> acknowledge <hi>ſome ſort of Providence,</hi> and think they ow <hi>ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> to the <hi>ſovereign Author</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52063:99"/>of the World,</hi> but deny <hi>a future State.</hi> There ſeems indeed to be a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difference betwixt <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> extravagant Suppoſitions; and ſo indeed there is, as to the <hi>Credibility of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> but the <hi>Influence</hi> it has <hi>upon Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> is very near the ſame; eſpecially with reſpect to thoſe of <hi>theſe latter days,</hi> to whom the <hi>Certainty of a future State</hi> hath been <hi>more fully</hi> diſcovered. For, if we conſider the <hi>preſent Poſture</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Human Affairs,</hi> and believe that things have <hi>always</hi> gone on in the <hi>ſame Courſe</hi> from the beginning, without any <hi>ſenſible extraordinary Interpoſition of Providence,</hi> as they that deny all <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> muſt believe; If, I ſay, we are of this Opinion, and obſerve how things are managed in the World; how <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> oftentimes <hi>thrives</hi> and <hi>flouriſhes,</hi> and that not only <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> but ſtrengthens and fixes itſelf upon as laſting Foundations as our Happineſs ſtands upon; and how, on the contrary, the <hi>Calamitics</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> of the <hi>Righteous</hi> are commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to their Lives, and a great many of them meerly owing to that <hi>Character,</hi> what Force or Power can ſome <hi>ſlight
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52063:99"/>Sentiments</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> have upon us, when the <hi>preſent Happineſs of this Life</hi> may be promoted by acting contrary to it, and we have nothing to <hi>loſe</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> after <hi>Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not examine how far we are <hi>oblig'd</hi> to act in ſuch a caſe, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>certain irreſiſtible Power of God,</hi> which he may exert, if he will, tho it ſhould be granted that he has not hitherto done it, or upon the account of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> we have received from him; but we ſhall find this true <hi>in fact,</hi> that thoſe who are <hi>firmly perſuaded</hi> that God <hi>will</hi> exert his Power no otherwiſe than he <hi>has done already,</hi> will not, by thoſe <hi>promiſcuous Puniſhments</hi> they ſee light upon <hi>all ſorts of Men</hi> at <hi>different Times</hi> and in <hi>different Circumſtances,</hi> be deter'd from proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Deſigns they have conceiv'd for the Attainment or Eſtabliſhment of their <hi>own Happineſs,</hi> by <hi>any means</hi> they ſhall think likely to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavor'd to give a true account and <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of all kind of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and to ſhew the <hi>neceſſary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of it, with reſpect to the <hi>Happineſs of Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52063:100"/>
            <p>And now, upon a fair and juſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> together, according to the different <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> of them; <hi>Religion</hi> muſt needs appear not only <hi>more agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>true Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Men in general, more ſuitable</hi> and <hi>proportionate</hi> to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities</hi> and <hi>Exigencies</hi> of <hi>Human Nature;</hi> but <hi>more conducive</hi> to the <hi>Happineſs of particular Men,</hi> in the <hi>preſent Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of <hi>human Societies</hi> in the World; ſo that, upon a due Balance of all the uſual Accidents of Life, 'tis <hi>very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> a <hi>Religious Man</hi> ſhould enjoy <hi>more Happineſs</hi> while he <hi>lives here,</hi> than a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of another Character:</hi> as might be fully and particularly made out if there was occaſion; but this requiring a ſet Diſcourſe on purpoſe, and not falling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly within my preſent Deſign, I think it ſufficient to mention ſome few general Conſiderations only, which ſhew the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages a <hi>Religious Man</hi> has above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that acts by <hi>contrary Principles.</hi> Such as are theſe following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> that acts upon a <hi>true thorough Senſe</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> has, with reſpect to all the <hi>external Enjoyments</hi> of the World, <hi>more
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52063:100"/>contracted Deſires</hi> and <hi>fewer Wants</hi> than another; and, conſequently, his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does much ſeldomer interfere with any other Man's, and is leſs obnoxious to the Aſſaults of <hi>Envy, Ambition</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi> than the proſperous Condition of the <hi>Wicked:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is not eager in the purſuit of the <hi>neceſſary Supports</hi> and <hi>leſſer Conveniencies</hi> of Life, and takes care to avoid all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Injury</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> of others; and therefore muſt be freer from the Effects of <hi>Anger, Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> than ſuch as advance their own Eaſe or Fortune by diſquieting and robbing others:</p>
            <p>He profeſſes to help and aſſiſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>other Men,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Worldly Advantage to himſelf; and therefore there will be a great many who will find it their Intereſt to defend and ſecure him, and perform ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Kindneſs to him, to engage his future Endeavours for them when there ſhall be occaſion; whereas, he that is known to act for himſelf only, will be truſted and aſſiſted no further than his own preſent Intereſt is perceived una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably to concur with another Man's:</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52063:101"/>
            <p>And laſtly, the Happineſs a <hi>Religious Man</hi> propoſes to himſelf in <hi>another Life</hi> is ſuch, as, he is firmly perſuaded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all <hi>Experience, Imagination,</hi> or <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Comprehenſion;</hi> and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Hopes</hi> of attaining it, being ſtrong and vigorous in proportion to his Belief, muſt afford him <hi>greater Pleaſure here</hi> than the Hopes of <hi>any other Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Life;</hi> and a well grounded Hope of the greateſt and happieſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a Man can frame to himſelf here, gradually increaſing by a ſucceſsful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the fineſt beſt-form'd Deſigns for the Attainment of it; is, I believe, compar'd with any <hi>actual Enjoyment</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the <hi>higheſt pitch of Pleaſure</hi> we can be ſenſible of, <hi>without a future Proſpect;</hi> which muſt be all this, and as much higher, as this Religious Hope is <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more durable in the Poſſeſſion,</hi> and the preſent Aſſurance of it <hi>leſs liable</hi> to <hi>Diſappointment</hi> and <hi>Defeat,</hi> as it certainly is, there being no <hi>external Accidents</hi> or <hi>Endeavours</hi> that can deprive us of it.</p>
            <p>This being the State and Condition of a <hi>Religious Man,</hi> he muſt be <hi>generally</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than the <hi>Wicked,</hi> in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:52063:101"/>tho perhaps not in <hi>their Judgment</hi> of him; as <hi>enjoying more Eaſe and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in himſelf,</hi> by a conſtant unalterable Succeſs in the purſuit of his main End; as being <hi>leſs expoſed</hi> to the <hi>Injuries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> by aſſiſting ſome, and a due Care not to intrench upon the Happineſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and being <hi>better able to bear</hi> thoſe <hi>real Calamities</hi> and <hi>Miſeries</hi> that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, by a certain, comfortable expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>ſuch Happineſs</hi> as will <hi>infinitely</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh <hi>all</hi> he can ſuffer within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of <hi>this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I think abundantly ſufficient for the Proof and Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Religion;</hi> but for a further confirmation of the Truth, and that I may leave no room for the <hi>Enemies of God and Mankind</hi> to glory in their Strength, as if they had as much to ſay for <hi>their Opinions</hi> if they might be heard;</p>
            <p n="5">V. I ſhall, in the next place, conſider the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Pretences</hi> of <hi>Irreligion;</hi> what <hi>can be alleged</hi> in defence of it, and what are the <hi>uſual Pleas</hi> for it; and from thence ſhew the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of

            <p>In the Proſecution of which Subject I ſhall obſerve theſe Steps or Meaſures:
<list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall enquire how far <hi>Irreligion</hi> is <hi>capable of being proved,</hi> what <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of proof it admits of.</item>
                  <item>2. I ſhall conſider the <hi>common Ways</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> of defending it.</item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall anſwer ſome of the <hi>principal Objections</hi> made uſe of againſt <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. I ſhall make ſome <hi>general Reflexions</hi> upon the <hi>different Grounds</hi> and <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations Religion</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> ſtand upon, and the <hi>different Conduct</hi> of thoſe who act under the Influence of the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then I am to enquire how far <hi>Irreligion</hi> is <hi>capable of Proof;</hi> that is, how far a Man is <hi>able</hi> to prove, there is <hi>no God, no Obligation of acting ſuch a way,</hi> if there be, or <hi>no future State of Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:52063:102"/>
            <p>Was a Man diſpoſed to believe all or any of this, or had a mind to convince others of the Truth of theſe Propoſitions, what way or Method could he take to ſatisfie his own or their Underſtanding? 'Tis plain that none of the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into are Objects of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Conſciouſneſs,</hi> we cannot ſee with our Eyes, nor feel with any intimate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that there is <hi>no God, Religion,</hi> or <hi>Future State;</hi> and therefore, <hi>no new Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi> or <hi>Obſervations</hi> of this nature, nor any <hi>old Teſtimonies</hi> or <hi>Authorities,</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſuch, have any place upon this Subject, any further than they furniſh Matter for <hi>Reaſoning</hi> and <hi>Reflexion,</hi> from whence we muſt immediately derive all the Knowledge we can have of any of the Propoſitions in queſtion; all which being <hi>negative,</hi> there's no other way of proving the Truth of them but by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either their <hi>Repugnancy</hi> or <hi>Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> to our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and thoſe <hi>other Principles of our Knowledge</hi> which we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly</hi> doubt of; the firſt way we <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate</hi> them to be <hi>certain,</hi> the latter we make them appear <hi>probable.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:52063:103"/>
            <p>As to <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> there's no way of <hi>demonſtrating</hi> a thing <hi>not to be,</hi> but by proving 'tis <hi>impoſſible</hi> and a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to <hi>be;</hi> and who will undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World that 'tis <hi>impoſſible</hi> there ſhould be a <hi>God?</hi> or ſuppoſing there be, that <hi>Religion</hi> and a <hi>Future State</hi> are <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Contradictions?</hi> What is there in any of theſe Notions that ſhocks our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and reſtrains our <hi>Aſſent?</hi> What other <hi>more certain</hi> Knowledge have we that makes our Belief of theſe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it? There was never any Proof of this kind offered or pretended to yet; the Vanity of all ſuch Attempts being eaſily diſcoverable upon the firſt Trial of our Underſtandings that way.</p>
            <p>All that remains then to be done, is, to produce ſuch Reaſons and Arguments for the <hi>Doctrines of Irreligion,</hi> to ſhew ſuch Marks and Characters of Truth upon them as ſhall render them <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable</hi> to our Minds; ſo that, upon a fair Propoſal, we ſhall be <hi>eaſily inclined</hi> to <hi>embrace</hi> and <hi>aſſent to</hi> them, tho the Evidence be not ſo ſtrong as <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> to <hi>determine us.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:52063:103"/>
            <p>This we call arguing from <hi>Probability;</hi> which is nothing elſe but an <hi>Appeal to the common Reaſon of Mankind;</hi> ſo that what the <hi>generality of Wiſe Men,</hi> in <hi>all Ages,</hi> have, upon due examination, aſſented to as <hi>moſt agreeable</hi> to <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is <hi>moſt probable;</hi> and, in matters of <hi>pure Reflexion</hi> deduced from the <hi>firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Knowledge, which are common to all Men alike, that have the ſame uſe of their Faculties, this muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a very good <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Probability:</hi> But <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> will never ſtand this teſt; the wiſe and learned part of the World ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſtantly rejected and condemned them.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the Diſquiſition was to begin <hi>now,</hi> and Men were to chuſe their Opinions again, how would a Perſon go about to prove that 'tis <hi>more agreeable</hi> to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Nature of Things</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>no God, no Religion,</hi> nor <hi>Future State,</hi> than that there ſhould be any of theſe?</p>
            <p>All the Arguments that can be made uſe of upon this occaſion, muſt be drawn from our <hi>own Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution,</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52063:104"/>and from the <hi>Exiſtence, Frame</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and all things <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us.</hi> We are <hi>certain</hi> that we <hi>are,</hi> and we know not our <hi>Original,</hi> or by what <hi>Power</hi> we came at firſt to be: We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a great many things <hi>without us,</hi> the <hi>Beginning</hi> of which we know not, nor by what means they came to exiſt: Is it <hi>therefore more likely</hi> and <hi>probable</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>no ſuch Being</hi> as we conceive to be the <hi>Author</hi> of all theſe things, than that there <hi>really is ſome ſuch perfect Being,</hi> which was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of theſe Effects we perceive? Can we, from the <hi>Oeconomy of the World</hi> and the <hi>Courſe of Nature,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that there is <hi>no governing</hi> and <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power</hi> in the <hi>Univerſe?</hi> Can we, from the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition of our own Minds,</hi> prove, that we are under <hi>no Law</hi> or <hi>Obligation</hi> of acting? or that <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>deſtructive</hi> of our <hi>Happineſs?</hi> Can we, from the <hi>Circumſtances of our Nature</hi> or the <hi>Conſtitution of things without us,</hi> make it <hi>reaſonable</hi> to think we ſhall <hi>not live again,</hi> be <hi>conſcious</hi> of all our <hi>former Actions,</hi> and be <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miſerable</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>different Kinds</hi> of them? However true theſe things <hi>may</hi> or <hi>are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52063:104"/>to be in themſelves,</hi> they will by no means <hi>follow</hi> from the <hi>forementioned Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and there can be <hi>no other</hi> but theſe imagined <hi>antecedent</hi> to them: For if <hi>God, Religion</hi> and a <hi>Future State</hi> are all <hi>poſſible,</hi> as they muſt be acknowledg'd to be, the <hi>real Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>any thing elſe</hi> will never furniſh any Argument for <hi>their Non-exiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In vain then do we expect any <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Proof</hi> of <hi>Irreligion.</hi> In the next place therefore I ſhall conſider the <hi>uſual Ways</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> of defending it which are theſe Four.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Ridiculing Religion.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Requiring a <hi>more certain Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> proof of it.</item>
               <item>3. Endeavouring to ſhew the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of things ſubſiſting <hi>without it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. And raiſing ſome <hi>looſe Objections</hi> againſt it, which chiefly aim at the <hi>preſent Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of it in the World.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe ways; 'tis certain that the <hi>Generality</hi> of thoſe who
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52063:105"/>advance or any of the forementioned O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, contain'd under the Notion of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> are ſuch as <hi>barely deny</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Truths, without giving any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their Disbelief: they ſpeak a bold thing againſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo fall to their Sins without ever examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of what they ſay; a <hi>light Word</hi> or <hi>Phraſe</hi> applied to a <hi>ſerious Thing,</hi> an <hi>odd Simile</hi> or <hi>Compariſon,</hi> a <hi>ridiculous Turn</hi> or <hi>Alluſion</hi> is all they pretend to.

            <p n="2">2. To the <hi>Second</hi> Way made uſe of by the Patrons of <hi>Irreligion</hi> to juſtifie their <hi>Infidelity;</hi> and that is, by alleging that the <hi>Doctrines of Religion</hi> and the <hi>Proofs</hi> given of it have not <hi>that Degree of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> they <hi>ought</hi> to have in order to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52063:105"/>their Conviction. Why, ſay they, are not ſuch important Points as thoſe, in which the Happineſs of <hi>Mankind</hi> is ſo far concern'd, made as plain and evident to our Underſtandings <hi>as any Propoſition in the Mathematicks?</hi> prove them to us in the <hi>ſame manner</hi> and we will believe them. The <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> and <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of which Plea will manifeſtly appear from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>For, firſt of all, 'tis very abſurd for Perſons to call for <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> Proof towards confirming the Truth of any thing before they have confuted one of thoſe Arguments that are already advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore the Proof that has been given of Religion, whatever it be, is ſufficient till it is overthrown by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Allegations.</p>
            <p>In the next place, 'tis ridiculous to ask for <hi>other Kind</hi> of Proof than the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> will bear; it being the ſame as to deſire that the Nature of Things ſhould be chang'd: and therefore to call for <hi>Mathematical Demonſtration</hi> in Points of <hi>Religion,</hi> is as much as to ſay, let <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> be turn'd into <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and we will believe it; the Meaning of which is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52063:106"/>only this, that ſuch Men as theſe like <hi>Mathematicks</hi> better than they do <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> For indeed the Perſons that call for this kind of Proof in <hi>Religion,</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of no ſuch thing as <hi>Demonſtration</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where but in <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Figures;</hi> whereas we have as <hi>clear Ideas</hi> of <hi>many other</hi> things, and do as evidently perceive the <hi>Agreement</hi> or <hi>Diſagreement</hi> of them, and make as <hi>certain Deductions</hi> from them; and that particularly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subject, where we have as clear and diſtinct Notions of <hi>Knowledge, Will, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Duration,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>other original Ideas</hi> from whence we took our firſt Riſe in the Proof of <hi>Religion</hi> as we have of <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> we are alſo as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Truth of thoſe Propoſitions, that <hi>Nothing can make it ſelf,</hi> that <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be eternal,</hi> that <hi>Motion muſt begin from Will,</hi> and ſeveral other from whence all our Arguments for <hi>Religion</hi> are deduced, as we are of ſuch <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Axioms</hi> as theſe, that <hi>the Whole is bigger than any of its Parts,</hi> that <hi>when equal Numbers are added to equal the whole is equal,</hi> and the like; and the <hi>Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of other Propoſitions from thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52063:106"/>is, in all the intermediate links of Connexion, as evidently perceived <hi>there</hi> as <hi>here,</hi> and the <hi>main Concluſions</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as any <hi>Mathematical Concluſion</hi> at the <hi>ſame Diſtance</hi> from the <hi>firſt Principles</hi> of that kind of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>In the Proof of a <hi>God</hi> this is very plain; and if the <hi>Obligations of Religion,</hi> and a <hi>Future State</hi> will not be allowed to have the <hi>ſame degree of Evidence,</hi> yet they have <hi>all the Certainty 'tis conceivable they ſhould have</hi> by way of Deduction from any Ideas our Minds are furniſht with; ſo that, ſuppoſing them true, they cannot be proved any otherwiſe from <hi>bare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted Reaſon;</hi> and therefore 'tis very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to require a <hi>further Demonſtration</hi> of them, when the <hi>rational Grounds</hi> they ſtand upon cannot be overthrown by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Proofs.</hi> I do not mention the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Advantage of <hi>Revelation,</hi> not to be diſproved by any <hi>Counter-revelation,</hi> becauſe that belongs to another place.</p>
            <p>But, beſides all this, where we are under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>judging</hi> one way, as we are in all ſuch matters where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our Happineſs to <hi>act</hi> or <hi>not to act,</hi> 'tis contrary to Reaſon not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52063:107"/>by <hi>that degree of Evidence,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that appears on <hi>one ſide,</hi> when we have nothing on the <hi>other ſide</hi> to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it, and therefore it muſt be very fooliſh and abſurd to take the Party of <hi>Irreligion</hi> for no other reaſon but this, that the <hi>Proofs of Religion</hi> have not <hi>all that Strength</hi> and <hi>Evidence of Conviction</hi> which <hi>ſome other Truths ſeem</hi> to have.

            <p>For ſhould we allow the <hi>Atheiſt's Scheme of things</hi> to be <hi>poſſible</hi> and <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent,</hi> which is the moſt that is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet we are aſſured, by the <hi>common Reaſon</hi> of Mankind, that the Philoſophy of a God is <hi>moſt rational</hi> without the Help of <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which confirm the Truth of it: and

            <p>And the ſame may be applied to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who <hi>acknowledge a God,</hi> and pretend to ſhew there is <hi>no ſuch thing</hi> as <hi>Religion</hi> and a <hi>Future State:</hi> For they cannot ſay that <hi>God</hi> who <hi>made the World,</hi> and all things in it, <hi>cannot overſee</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> the Works of his hands; that He, who <hi>gave Man his Being,</hi> and <hi>all his Faculties</hi> and <hi>Capacities, cannot require</hi> him to <hi>act</hi> after ſuch a manner <hi>while he lives,</hi> or <hi>is not able</hi> to <hi>renew</hi> him again <hi>after Death,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> his Life to him in <hi>ſuch a State</hi> as <hi>he pleaſes to make agreeable</hi> or <hi>diſagreeable</hi> to him, and <hi>as long as he pleaſes:</hi> This is to bring Weakneſs out of Strength, to ſet Bounds to God within the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Sphere of his Power, to ſay he

               <hi>Diſſolution of the Body;</hi> nor are there any Arguments producible to perſuade us 'tis <hi>more probable</hi> that the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhould be ſomething <hi>material</hi> and <hi>diſſolved with the Body,</hi> than that it ſhould be a <hi>diſtinct Principle</hi> and <hi>ſurvive it.</hi> All that can be ſaid, is, that we <hi>cannot,</hi> from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of the Qualities and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations we attribute to each, <hi>certainly demonſtrate</hi> what we term <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>two diſtinct Subſtances;</hi> tho, at the ſame time, it muſt be confeſs'd, that Men have been <hi>generally more diſpoſed</hi> to believe <hi>this</hi> than the <hi>contrary</hi> Opinion; and 'tis <hi>as demonſtrable</hi> that what we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the <hi>Soul</hi> is not any <hi>Mode, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> or <hi>Reſult</hi> of the <hi>Qualities</hi> we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to <hi>Body,</hi> as it is that <hi>any Idea</hi> we have in our Minds is <hi>not any other.</hi>

            <p>Allowing then that 'tis <hi>poſſible</hi> that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing we aſcribe to <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately</hi> may be <hi>united</hi> in <hi>one common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> which is the moſt that can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and that <hi>this common Subject,</hi> at the time we call <hi>Death</hi> loſes thoſe <hi>Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> we attribute to the <hi>Soul,</hi> in the ſame manner as it is diveſted of <hi>Motion;</hi> from hence it follows, that it is

               <hi>poſſible</hi> alſo that the <hi>ſame common Subject</hi> may never ſubſiſt in the ſame manner it did before, with all thoſe different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities united in it, in like manner as 'tis poſſible what is now at reſt may never be in motion again. But then it is <hi>as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> alſo that it <hi>may:</hi> God <hi>may,</hi> if he pleaſes, put us together again after death, in ſuch a manner that we ſhall feel our ſelves to be the ſame we were before we died, and be conſcious of all our former Life; and that he <hi>will</hi> do ſo we have a great deal of reaſon to think, had we not any aſſurance of it from <hi>Revelation,</hi> as has before been proved. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arguments for the <hi>Materiality</hi> and <hi>Mortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> let them have all the Weight and Certainty they are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to have, are wholly trifling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, with reſpect to what they are brought to prove: For no <hi>new Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are hereby made of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and, conſequently the Proof that has been given of <hi>Religion</hi> and a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State,</hi> will have the ſame Force and Evidence ſtill, tho the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhould be granted to be <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Mortal:</hi> we ſhould have all the ſame Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52063:110"/>that <hi>God does require us to act</hi> after ſuch a manner, and <hi>will reward</hi> or <hi>puniſh</hi> us in <hi>another Life</hi> according as we behave our ſelves in <hi>this; no Arguments</hi> made uſe of in the Proof of this Point, being taken from the <hi>Immaterial</hi> and <hi>Immortal Nature</hi> of our Souls, but from what we <hi>certainly, by infallible Conſciouſneſs, know</hi> of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and what, by <hi>evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> we <hi>collect</hi> of the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> which every Man that owns ſuch a Being muſt aſcribe to him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I examined the Pretences of thoſe Adverſaries of Religion, who take upon them to eſtabliſh <hi>new Principles</hi> and <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> to explain the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things by; and have ſhewn, that the utmoſt that they aim at, is, to make it <hi>ſeem poſſible</hi> that <hi>thoſe Appearances</hi> in the World, from whence we infer the <hi>Being of a God, Religion,</hi> and a <hi>Future State, may</hi> be <hi>otherwiſe</hi> accounted for; without endeavouring to <hi>deſtroy our Scheme;</hi> or, upon a juſt compariſon in all points, to ſhew that <hi>theirs</hi> is a <hi>more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Syſtem.</p>

            <p>As to the firſt of theſe Objections, I ſhall conſider it no farther than as it is made uſe of to weaken the Credibility of <hi>all Religion;</hi> and 'tis ſufficient to expoſe the Weakneſs of it by ſhewing the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            </p>
            <p>Moſt of the <hi>particular Cavils</hi> againſt <hi>Scripture</hi> have been fully anſwered by thoſe who have purpoſely undertook the Defence of <hi>Revelation:</hi> but this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at preſent to ſhew, that nothing of this kind proves any thing againſt the Truth of <hi>Scripture in general,</hi> much leſs againſt the <hi>firſt Fundamental Principles of Religion,</hi> which I have endeavoured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh.</p>

               <hi>Bigotry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> have oftentimes produced as dreadful and pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to a Country or Nation, as the wild Liberties and Extravagancies of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> could do: but what's that to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which ſuffers equally both ways, and is no more the <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> than the <hi>other? Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and all Actions tending to the <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> or <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of Mankind are as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52063:113"/>
               <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Nature of Religion</hi> when exerciſed by a <hi>ſuperſtitious Zealot,</hi> as when practiſed by an <hi>Atheiſt;</hi> tho the former covers them with that Name, and the latter does not: and therefore <hi>true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is very unjuſtly and unreaſonably condemn'd upon this account.</p>
            <p>Another fooliſh Objection is, that <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Opinions</hi> which is found among the <hi>Profeſſors of Religion,</hi> and their <hi>perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Cenſures</hi> of one another for holding falſe and abſurd Doctrines.</p>
            <p>What a ſtrange <hi>Diſagreement</hi> is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men in <hi>Points of Religion?</hi> ſay thoſe that have none at all. <hi>Some</hi> believe <hi>one thing</hi> and <hi>ſome another; ſome</hi> expound <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Senſe, and <hi>ſome</hi> in <hi>that; Creed</hi> is ſet up againſt <hi>Creed,</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> againſt <hi>Altar;</hi> what <hi>one</hi> Man thinks his <hi>Duty, another</hi> apprehends <hi>Damnation</hi> from. Suppoſing then we have our Opinions to chuſe, what is to be done in ſuch a Caſe? ſhall we take the <hi>ſtrongeſt Side,</hi> what the <hi>moſt,</hi> or what, we think the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? or ſhall we examine the Reaſons of <hi>all Sides impartially without Prejudice,</hi> and let our Judgments be determined by
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52063:113"/>the <hi>greateſt Appearance of Evidence?</hi> No, we will do none of all this; but, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining their ſeveral Pleas, we will take up Opinions <hi>different</hi> from <hi>all of them:</hi> and becauſe <hi>one</hi> Man denies <hi>one</hi> thing, and <hi>another</hi> another, we will be ſure to be free from thoſe Errors they condemn one another for, and <hi>deny</hi> what <hi>no Body elſe</hi> does, what <hi>all the different Parties</hi> ſubſcribe to and <hi>agree</hi> in. Theſe are the Reſolutions of the <hi>Irreligious;</hi> and what a ſtrange Contradiction is this to make <hi>Unity of Conſent</hi> the <hi>Character of Truth,</hi> and yet allow no Opinions to be true but thoſe that have the <hi>leaſt pretence</hi> to it?</p>
            <p>Neither is it more juſt and reaſonable to condemn <hi>all Religion</hi> upon the account of the <hi>weak Defence</hi> and Patronage of <hi>ſome of its Profeſſors.</hi> What if the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſhould be able to defeat ſome trifling Argument of <hi>ignorant well-meaning Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> or <hi>ſuperſtitious Zeal?</hi> to triumph pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and cry out that <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Phrenſy</hi> was the Mother of <hi>all Devotion</hi> would be as fooliſh a Boaſt as for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to deſpiſe the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:52063:114"/>of his Enemy, becauſe he had plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two or three ſmall open Villages, when all the great Towns, and the chief Strength of the Kingdom had been unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted or attempted in vain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſcandalous Practices</hi> of <hi>Men of great Pretences to Piety,</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> as, by their <hi>peculiar manner of Life,</hi> are look'd upon to be <hi>wholly in the Intereſts of Religion</hi> is another very unwarrantable Occaſion of ſome Mens disbelieving every thing that goes under that Name: who infer from hence, that ſuch Perſons as theſe do not believe Religion <hi>themſelves,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there's no more Reaſon to think that <hi>others</hi> do, tho they diſguiſe their Notions better, in order to ſerve their preſent Intereſt; eſpecially if they be Men of ſuch Senſe as is ſufficient to put them above the ſuſpicion of <hi>vulgar Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.</hi> But this Argument is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>unconcluding</hi> in <hi>all its Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, Firſt of all, it does not follow, That ſuch Men as theſe believe nothing <hi>themſelves</hi> of what they profeſs; the <hi>truer Inference</hi> is, That <hi>corrupt Nature, vicious Habits,</hi> and a <hi>looſe Education</hi> are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52063:114"/>too hard for <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it being very plain that the ſame thing happens in ſeveral other Caſes. For there's <hi>no Man</hi> whatſoever, be his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples never ſo looſe and wide, his Reaſon never ſo much deprav'd, but ſhall many times do what he himſelf ſhall condemn himſelf for doing, and which contradicts the Principles he reſolv'd to ſtand by: and therefore, for a Man to infer from <hi>ſome groſs Sins of a Pretender to Religion,</hi> that he does <hi>not believe</hi> any thing of what he profeſſes, is as abſurd as to prove that an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> does certainly <hi>believe a God,</hi> whatever he ſays to the contrary, becauſe he often <hi>ſwears by him,</hi> and <hi>invokes him</hi> in his <hi>Curſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, ſuppoſe this true of <hi>ſome</hi> Men who pretend to a great Senſe of Religion themſelves, or undertake to promote it in others, that they <hi>do not believe</hi> any thing of it; as there are ſometimes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions ſtrong enough to induce us to judg ſo, what reaſon have we from hence to conclude that <hi>others</hi> of a more unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Conduct are all of the ſame mind, if we could but ſee to the Bottom of them? or, what if there be a great many
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52063:115"/>
               <hi>falſe Pretenders</hi> to <hi>Religion?</hi> how is this an <hi>Argument</hi> againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of it? we have no reaſon indeed to believe it upon their Word; nor does their contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ſay by their Practice give us any more reaſon to disbelieve it. Nor, if <hi>ſome of thoſe</hi> whoſe <hi>peculiar Employment it is,</hi> and whoſe <hi>preſent Intereſt</hi> it <hi>ſeems</hi> to be to propagate and advance the Belief of <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, ſhould be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to believe nothing of it <hi>themſelves,</hi> would it follow from hence, that their Unbelief was occaſion'd by knowing more of it than others, and being better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the whole <hi>Myſtery</hi> and <hi>Contrivance:</hi> this is evidently proved to be falſe by the Experience of thoſe who have thought more and enquir'd further concerning theſe things than the reſt of the World have done; for the <hi>more they have conſider'd</hi> the fundamental Doctrines of Religion, and the <hi>more juſt and exact</hi> they have been in tracing and examining all their Reaſonings about them, the <hi>ſtronger</hi> have they been confirm'd in the Belief of them. But if there <hi>really are</hi> ſuch Men, as, for argument's ſake, we have <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> they were certainly <hi>Atheiſts before</hi> they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52063:115"/>put on the <hi>Garb of Religion:</hi> and what ſhould hinder an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> from taking up this Diſguiſe, and preparing himſelf for it by a cloſe Diſſimulation, who thinks all Means lawful for the promoting his preſent Intereſt in this World; and 'tis not every Atheiſt's good fortune to be better provided for in <hi>another Condition of Life,</hi> than he might probably be in <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Religious Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if the <hi>Generality</hi> of <hi>all ſorts</hi> of Men muſt be allow'd <hi>really to believe</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> they <hi>profeſs,</hi> this, ſays the <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> is the Reaſon of it; A ſtrange prevalence of <hi>Fear,</hi> and ſtrong Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Education</hi> have captivated their Underſtandings, and diſpoſed them all to the ſame way of Reaſoning. Upon this account it is that there have been ſo few true Philoſophers, that were able to think rightly and judge clearly of things; But now and then ſome bold Genius has ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to ſhake off his Chains, and aſſert the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and as <hi>one Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo <hi>one Epicurus</hi> or <hi>Lucretius</hi> is enough for one Age: ſuch Spirits are not of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52063:116"/>Make,</hi> and appear in the World but ſeldom, and are therefore to be admired. To which it may be ſufficient to anſwer, that I have already proved <hi>Religion</hi> to be the <hi>neceſſary Iſſue</hi> and <hi>Product of Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>firſt unqueſtionable Principles</hi> of <hi>all our Knowledge;</hi> and therefore, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe</hi> is aſſigned as a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it muſt be <hi>falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have this further Conſideration to add, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Effects of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> never are ſo uniform, laſting and univerſal as the Belief of Religion is obſerved to be, eſpecially when they act contrary to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of things, as they are ſuppoſed to do in this caſe; That Men are as much and as often diſpoſed to <hi>deny</hi> as to <hi>believe</hi> what they <hi>fear,</hi> when the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> for fear are the ſame, and more inclin'd to the former when the things feared are repreſented at a great Diſtance; That <hi>ſenſual Appetites, Habits of indulging them, preſent Enjoyments,</hi> or <hi>near Proſpects of Pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms of living contrary to the Rules of Religion,</hi> have a much ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more powerful Influence upon the Judgments of Men, than ſuch Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52063:116"/>of <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Education</hi> which contradict all theſe; eſpecially if <hi>Reaſon</hi> be of the <hi>ſame ſide</hi> with them, as the Patrons of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion muſt ſay; And therefore, neither <hi>Fear</hi> nor <hi>Education</hi> nor <hi>both</hi> together can be the <hi>true Cauſe</hi> of ſuch a <hi>general Belief</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> as is profeſs'd in the World; but the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>things believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Objection I ſhall mention, which the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> thinks the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and a perfect Diſcovery of the whole Myſtery, is, That <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Politick Contrivance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that which gives occaſion for ſuch a Suſpicion, is, That all the chiefeſt Politicians, in their wiſe Precepts of Advice, have thought it neceſſary for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Prince to encourage and promote <hi>Religion</hi> in his Country, and to have a Shew of it himſelf whatever his inward Sentiments were. But <hi>this</hi> is ſo far from being any Plea for Atheiſm, that 'tis a very ſtrong Argument for the <hi>Truth, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity of Religion:</hi> For that is certainly highly rational which is moſt ſuitable and agreeable to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52063:117"/>
               <hi>publick Reaſon of Mankind</hi> conſidered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in Society;</hi> without which there would be little Uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> at all. And, if Men are <hi>born ſociable Creatures,</hi> if they <hi>naturally deſire Society,</hi> and Society cannot poſſibly <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> without <hi>Religion,</hi> as the Objection it ſelf ſuppoſes, then is <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> and as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to his <hi>Happineſs</hi> as <hi>Converſation</hi> and <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together.</hi> And were it not for <hi>other Mens</hi> having <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> would find it very uncomfortable living in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> are the chief <hi>Pleas, Defences</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> commonly urg'd and inſiſted upon by the <hi>Enemies of Religion.</hi> And, if there be any other, which have not been here particularly conſidered, they admit of the ſame Anſwers as thoſe that are here mentioned, or may be as eaſily accounted for out of the Proofs before given of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and therefore, without ſpending more time in making <hi>little Cavils</hi> and <hi>groundleſs Suſpicions</hi> look conſiderable by a formal Examination and Anſwer of them, I ſhall paſs to the</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:52063:117"/>4. Next thing I propoſed to do, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſhew the Abſurdity and <hi>Folly</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of thoſe who <hi>reject</hi> the great important Truths. of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> and that is to make ſome <hi>general Reflexions</hi> upon the <hi>different Grounds</hi> and <hi>Foundations Religion</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> ſtand upon, and the <hi>different Conduct</hi> of thoſe that act under the Influence of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>Now, upon a ſtrict and impartial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of all that has been offered or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in this Cauſe, we ſhall find that all the ſeveral Propoſitions, contained under the Notion of <hi>Religion,</hi> have been proved to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>agreeable to our Reaſon,</hi> by a <hi>direct Deduction</hi> from the <hi>firſt Principles of our Knowledge;</hi> which Deduction, in moſt of the Parts of it, has all the Evidence and Certainty any conſequential Truths can have, and in the other as much as the Nature of the things proved is capable of, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition and Circumſtances of our Being, and ſuch as the Mind fully aſſents to, without being able to entertain the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52063:118"/>leaſt Suſpicion of a Miſtake, tho it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove there is not a bare Poſſibility of Error.</p>
            <p>It will likewiſe appear that <hi>Religion,</hi> in all the particular Branches and Duties of it, is admirably <hi>fitted</hi> for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>Mankind in general,</hi> conſidering their <hi>preſent State</hi> and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World: And further, that 'tis highly probable at leaſt, if not evident, that the greateſt degree of Happineſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>particular</hi> Man, abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is capable of, will be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his regular Diſcharge of all the Obligations of Religion, and that <hi>proportionably</hi> to a Man's <hi>Behaviour,</hi> in <hi>this reſpect,</hi> while <hi>he lives,</hi> ſhall his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> be in <hi>another State;</hi> but in every proportion greater than can be conceived or imagined by us now.</p>
            <p>And as the Truth of theſe Matters will appear to be made out from the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Nature of things;</hi> ſo will it be further manifeſt that the <hi>general Opinion of the World</hi> has always went the ſame way: and, if <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> could be of any uſe here, that far the moſt and greateſt is on this Side.</p>
            <pb n="215" facs="tcp:52063:118"/>
            <p>Beſides, we ſhall not be only ſatisfied of theſe things by a <hi>poſitive direct Proof;</hi> but we ſhall ſee the <hi>contrary Hypotheſes</hi> proved <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>impoſſible;</hi> or, where any thing <hi>poſſible</hi> is advanced, we ſhall perceive it <hi>leſs probable</hi> in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> drawn from it <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we ſhall likewiſe be convinc'd that <hi>Libertiniſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> do evidently and directly tend to the <hi>Miſery of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>State</hi> they <hi>now are in,</hi> and will very probably, if not certainly, render every <hi>particular</hi> Perſon that owns or acts by theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, inconceivably more miſerable in <hi>another State</hi> of Life; and that in <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to his <hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>Violation</hi> of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſcribed by Religion.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, we ſhall find that the <hi>Doctrines of Irreligion</hi> have <hi>none of theſe Grounds of Credibility,</hi> nor <hi>are</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be defended by <hi>any of theſe Ways</hi> or <hi>Methods</hi> by which Religion is eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p>That they, conſiſting wholly in the <hi>Denial</hi> and <hi>Contradiction</hi> of other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, do not admit of any <hi>poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> Proof, but muſt be proved by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52063:119"/>the Truth of the Aſſertions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Aſſertions denied</hi> cannot be ſhewed to be <hi>falſe,</hi> either from their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy</hi> or <hi>Diſagreeableneſs</hi> to our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>antecedent Principles</hi> of Knowledge; or their <hi>Inconſiſtence</hi> with our <hi>Happineſs;</hi> nor from the <hi>common Suffrage</hi> and <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Mankind;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the <hi>negative Principles of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi> and the <hi>practical Conſequences</hi> of them cannot, upon a <hi>juſt Compariſon,</hi> be proved to be <hi>more ſuitable</hi> to our <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Happineſs</hi> than the <hi>contrary Doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall likewiſe, upon a ſlight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the <hi>common Arguments</hi> and <hi>Pleas</hi> for <hi>Irreligion,</hi> be eaſily ſatisfied that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this is ſo much as pretended to; but that the ſtrongeſt Effort of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Invention that way reaches no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an <hi>Offer at explaining</hi> the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Appearances,</hi> the <hi>Original, Order, Courſe</hi> and <hi>Event</hi> of things, <hi>without a God, independently of him,</hi> or with <hi>Excluſion to</hi> thoſe particular Conſequences reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, which go under the Name of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Sin, Reward</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> and that the moſt any Endeavours of this
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52063:119"/>kind can amount to, is, to ſhew that 'tis <hi>poſſible</hi> things <hi>may be,</hi> after that particular manner they are explained to be.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>different Grounds</hi> and <hi>Proofs</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Irreligion:</hi> which if we carefully compare together, it will eaſily appear that they do not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs rational;</hi> but that <hi>all the Reaſon</hi> lies on the ſide of <hi>Religion;</hi> the <hi>Conception</hi> or <hi>Proof</hi> of a <hi>bare Poſſibility</hi> of the World's ſubſiſting <hi>without</hi> any ſuch thing, being no manner of Argument that there <hi>is none.</hi> And therefore it muſt be very abſurd to deny <hi>all the Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and every thing brought in defence of them upon <hi>this account only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But allowing there may be a great deal more ſaid for <hi>Irreligion</hi> ſo as to render it <hi>ſomething probable</hi> to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet if the <hi>poſitive direct Proofs</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> ſtand good, without conſidering thoſe which pretend to ſhew the <hi>Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of a <hi>contrary Scheme,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> cannot ſtand upon <hi>ſo ſure</hi> and <hi>firm</hi> a <hi>bottom</hi> as the <hi>latter,</hi> nor be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>ſo high a Degree of Credibility;</hi> and therefore it muſt be very unreaſonable to give our aſſent on that ſide where
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52063:120"/>there is the <hi>leaſt Appearance</hi> of <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the <hi>Proof</hi> on both ſides <hi>equal, ſuch different Conſequences</hi> do attend the Belief of the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other,</hi> that 'tis the Extremity of Madneſs and Folly to prefer the <hi>Party of Irreligion.</hi> Which, beſides the <hi>preſent particular Pains, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> and <hi>Diſadvantages</hi> it is ſaid to bring upon the Perſons that make this Choice, and the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> and <hi>Inconveniences Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> will certainly ſuffer from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this account; beſides all this, I ſay, it is threatned with <hi>eternal, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Miſery</hi> to come <hi>after this Life.</hi> And this is a Conſequence ſo concerning and dreadful, that it muſt be a <hi>vaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderancy of Proof</hi> that can juſtifie our running the hazard of it; which, I am ſure, is more than any Man that makes the venture can pretend to.</p>
            <p>I do not here argue, that a Man ought to prefer <hi>Religion</hi> before <hi>Irreligion</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe 'tis <hi>ſafer</hi> ſo to do; becauſe, by the <hi>Confeſſion of all Parties,</hi> a Man ſhall not ſuffer any thing in another ſtate by ſuch a Choice, whereas he that chuſes <hi>Irreligion</hi> has only his <hi>own Opinion</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:52063:120"/>for his ſecurity, and is threatned by the Perſons of a contrary Perſuaſion with <hi>eternal Miſery</hi> after Death: I do not think <hi>this alone</hi> a <hi>ſufficient</hi> reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a Man's Choice to one ſide, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all other Arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for then a Man might be threatned out of <hi>any thing:</hi> but, if the Evil threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be <hi>very conſiderable,</hi> and 'tis <hi>full as probable</hi> that it ſhould happen, as it is that it ſhould not, which is the Caſe now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, he acts very rationally and wiſely, who chuſes rather to undergo <hi>ſome leſſer Inconveniences</hi> at <hi>preſent</hi> than put himſelf <hi>in danger</hi> of <hi>greater.</hi> Now, that the <hi>Miſery</hi> annex'd to <hi>Irreligion</hi> is <hi>very conſiderable</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, it being ſuppoſed greater than can be <hi>imagined</hi> or <hi>conceived</hi> by us: and that it is <hi>as probable</hi> it <hi>ſhould</hi> be the Portion of all thoſe that believe and act by ſuch Principles as <hi>not,</hi> muſt be allow'd whatever <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> be true.</p>
            <p>For if <hi>Chance</hi> made the World, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the <hi>Characters of Wiſdom</hi> we behold in it, why may it not as well happen that there ſhould be a <hi>Future State,</hi> and that thoſe we call <hi>Irreligious</hi> ſhould be <hi>miſerable</hi> in it, and the <hi>Religious
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52063:121"/>happy?</hi> It looks indeed like <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and ſo does the <hi>Regularity of the World,</hi> and a great many <hi>conſtant Diſcriminations</hi> made there. Why ſhould the Wind blow down the <hi>rotten</hi> Fruit and leave the <hi>ſound?</hi> why ſhould the Plague ſweep away <hi>ſome</hi> and leave <hi>others</hi> in the ſame City or Houſe? but there are <hi>natural Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Cauſes</hi> for theſe things: ſo there may be for the other, for ought we know; the <hi>Wicked</hi> may be <hi>peculiarly diſpoſed</hi> to be <hi>miſerable;</hi> the ſame <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> that inclined them to be <hi>wicked</hi> may to be <hi>miſerable</hi> alſo when they <hi>live again,</hi> and there is <hi>as much Chance</hi> for their <hi>living again</hi> as for their <hi>firſt Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if all things exiſt by <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> then a <hi>Future State</hi> may be <hi>neceſſary</hi> too, and the <hi>Wicked neceſſarily miſerable</hi> in it, for any thing there is in <hi>this Hypotheſis</hi> to the <hi>contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where <hi>every thing</hi> is ſuppoſed <hi>caſual</hi> or <hi>every thing neceſſary,</hi> 'tis impoſſible to give <hi>any reaſon</hi> why any thing that may be conceived ſuture <hi>ſhould</hi> or <hi>ſhould not exiſt,</hi> or <hi>ſhould</hi> or <hi>ſhould not</hi> be after <hi>ſuch</hi> or <hi>ſuch a manner;</hi> and therefore all things of this nature muſt be <hi>equally probable:</hi> nothing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52063:121"/>can be alleged to determine the Mind <hi>one</hi> way <hi>rather</hi> than <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, if there be a <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> that <hi>are, have been,</hi> or <hi>are to be</hi> are acknowledged to be the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>his Will,</hi> there are no Reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us 'tis <hi>more probable</hi> that <hi>God will not puniſh the Wicked</hi> in <hi>another State</hi> than that he <hi>will;</hi> at leaſt they have not yet been produced.</p>
            <p>From whence it follows, That it being <hi>equally probable</hi> in <hi>every Hypotheſis</hi> that the Irreligious will be <hi>extreamly miſerable,</hi> they have <hi>no more reaſon</hi> to chuſe <hi>that ſide</hi> they are of than the <hi>other,</hi> by <hi>their own Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Account of things;</hi> and therefore, in <hi>this Caſe,</hi> a Man muſt not <hi>act at all,</hi> or, if he does prefer <hi>acting one way</hi> rather than another, the <hi>general Opinion of others</hi> concerning the <hi>ſafeſt ſide</hi> ſhould <hi>determine</hi> him. But moreover, it is not only <hi>as probable</hi> that the <hi>Irreligious</hi> ſhould be <hi>miſerable</hi> in a <hi>future ſtate</hi> allowing <hi>any of their own Hypotheſes</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> but, by their own way of Proof it appears that <hi>our Hypotheſis</hi> is <hi>as likely</hi> to be true as <hi>any</hi> advanced by <hi>them,</hi> nothing further than a <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of <hi>theirs</hi> being aim'd at.</p>

            <p>And not only ſo; but <hi>we</hi> do <hi>moreover</hi> pretend by <hi>many direct</hi> and <hi>poſitive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to evince the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>ours;</hi> and at the ſame time to ſhew <hi>all theirs</hi> to be <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, if upon an <hi>equal Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> we ought to take the <hi>ſafeſt</hi> meaſures, <hi>much more</hi> are we obliged ſo to do when <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> are <hi>both</hi> of the <hi>ſame Side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay farther, He that prefers <hi>that Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> which <hi>Eternal Miſery in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other State</hi> is denounc'd againſt, ought not only to have <hi>more Grounds of Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of his ſide, but <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Conviction;</hi> he ſhould be <hi>fully</hi> ſatisfied, from <hi>certain direct Principles,</hi> that his <hi>own Opinions</hi> are <hi>right,</hi> or that the <hi>contrary</hi> are <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>irrational:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Conſequences</hi> are of that <hi>vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> that the <hi>preſent Inconveniences</hi> we are <hi>like</hi> to ſuſtain by acting a <hi>contrary way</hi> can bear <hi>no proportion</hi> to the <hi>hazard</hi> or <hi>likelihood of Miſery</hi> that attends <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>theirs,</hi> without meeting with the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from us; and then urge us to take the <hi>ſafeſt ſide:</hi> Thus, I ſay, do we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; did we believe <hi>their Opinions</hi> or <hi>Cenſures probable,</hi> the 'twas <hi>poſſible,</hi> and to us perhaps ſeem'd <hi>as probable</hi> or <hi>more ſo,</hi> that they might be <hi>falſe,</hi> we would <hi>then</hi> allow ſome Weight in the Argument: But we do not <hi>now</hi> go over to them upon the account of <hi>Safety,</hi> becauſe we not only <hi>think our Opinions certain</hi> and <hi>theirs impoſſible, abſurd</hi> or <hi>irrational,</hi> and are fully perſuaded we have <hi>proved</hi> them ſo; but, ſuppoſing our ſelves to err in all the Points in controverſie betwixt us, we think it <hi>demonſtrable</hi> from <hi>common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> own'd on <hi>both ſides,</hi> that none of theſe <hi>Errors,</hi> which, upon due care for better information, are believed by us <hi>as Truths,</hi> can expoſe us to the <hi>hazard of Damnation,</hi> if in all things elſe we live up to the Principles of our Religion.

            <p>But to deny all theſe important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Truths, without offering at any Proof of their Falſhood; to ſay they are doubtful and uncertain Points, and yet to act with the ſame Aſſurance and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity as if they were certainly falſe; to refuſe our Aſſent to them for want of greater and more evident Proof, without confuting the Arguments already advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or producing ſtronger on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide; to laugh at the Terrors of the Lord, without proving them firſt to be vain or reſiſtible; to contradict the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Belief of the World, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any new Diſcoveries or Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to lay aſide a whole Scheme and Syſtem of things, which has been proved and eſtabliſhed in all the principal Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Connexions of it, becauſe we

            </p>
            <p>There's another thing alſo which the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> commonly diſcovers his Folly in, and that is the <hi>publiſhing</hi> and <hi>propagating</hi> his Opinions: For 'tis more the <hi>Atheiſt</hi>'s Intereſt that <hi>other</hi> People ſhould have <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> than 'tis the <hi>Religious Man</hi>'s.

            <pb n="226" facs="tcp:52063:125"/>
            <p>Other Proofs likewiſe, of the <hi>Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi> and <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of <hi>Irreligion</hi> might be brought from the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> both of the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of ſuch as are profeſs'd Favourers of it: ſuch as their Credulity and readineſs of Belief in <hi>common</hi> indifferent Matters, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times embracing abſurd Opinions explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all the World, when at the ſame time they are diſtruſtful of every thing upon the Subject of <hi>Religion;</hi> their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Matters that concern their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Happineſs upon leſs Grounds; their expoſing themſelves to greater Troubles and Inconveniences, and running greater Hazards upon a fainter Proſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs in this Life; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, on the contrary, fearing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding things upon a leſs Appearance or Likelyhood of Danger than what <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> affords; and laſtly, their acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own Principles, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves what they eſteem ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Happineſs out of a regard to imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Notions, which have no Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but in the Opinion of Men. But, theſe being Matters of common Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and too long to be fully inſiſted
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52063:125"/>upon here, I ſhall think it ſufficient to have hinted at them, and ſo paſs on to the</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Sixth and laſt general Branch of my Diſcourſe propoſed in the beginning of it, and that is, To give ſome Account of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of all <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> or the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that induce Men to take up ſuch Opinions.</p>
            <p>There's nothing People are better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of than the Power nnd Influence of <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>falſe Motives</hi> of <hi>Judging;</hi> every body being apt to reſolve the Cauſe of another Mans differing in opinion from him into ſome particular <hi>Byaſs</hi> upon his Underſtanding. But this we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without examining whether the Perſon that differs from us has not better Reaſons for his Diſſent than we have for our Perſuaſion; whether the Opinion he is of be not, in the Reality of things, true, tho he believes upon falſe Grounds; or whether we our ſelves are not diſpoſed to judg as we do, upon ſome of the like Motives we ſuppoſe him to be directed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52063:126"/>by. By which means we are often not only guilty of the ſame Partiality we charge upon others, but either confirm'd in our Errors, or elſe prevented from making juſt Enquiries into the Truth of things; ſo that, if we are in the right, it is by chance, and more than we are able to prove to our ſelves or others.</p>
            <p>Upon which account I think it a very prepoſterous and deceitful Method of proving a thing falſe, to aſſign ſome <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Prejudices</hi> and <hi>wrong Motives of judging,</hi> which may <hi>poſſibly</hi> induce Men to be of ſuch an Opinion, tho the Truth ſhould be of the other ſide, and which have often had the like Influence upon Men's Underſtandings in other Matters; and from thence immediately, without any further Proof, to infer, that ſuch and ſuch Perſons have <hi>no other Reaſons</hi> for their Belief of the point in queſtion, and conſequently, that they are in the wrong: this, I ſay, is not a fair way of arguing. But, after <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>manifeſt Proofs</hi> of the Truth of an Opinion, according to the <hi>ſtanding Rules</hi> and <hi>Principles of Reaſoning,</hi> it is not only <hi>proper</hi> to enquire how any People came to be of a contrary Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52063:126"/>but the Strangeneſs and ſeeming Unaccountableneſs of the thing make it <hi>expected,</hi> and in ſome reſpect <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in order to a fuller Satisfaction of thoſe, who, notwithſtanding all the <hi>appearance of Evidence to themſelves,</hi> may be apt to have ſuch favourable Notions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as not to imagine that Perſons who have the ſame Faculties and all other Advantages of Knowledge as they have ſhould deny what appears ſo plain to them, without ſome <hi>rational Grounds</hi> for their Denial.</p>
            <p>Having therefore, as I perſuade my ſelf, <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>evidently</hi> proved the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> I think, I may now be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to ſay, That <hi>all Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> muſt be the <hi>ſole Effect</hi> of <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Prepoſſeſſion,</hi> if any ſuch Cauſe of it is aſſignable.</p>
            <p>And if we ſearch the Heart of Man, and look into the hidden Myſteries of Iniquity lodg'd there, if we conſider all the falſe and corrupt <hi>Reaſonings,</hi> and the ſeveral Arts and Methods of Deceit which are uſed by Men to delude themſelves, we ſhall ſoon diſcover the ſecret <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of all <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:52063:127"/>
            <p>Now, the <hi>Cauſes</hi> from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds are theſe two, <hi>The Fear of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-reckoning for a wicked Life,</hi> and <hi>The Pride and Vanity of appearing greater or wiſer than other Men.</hi> The firſt of which is the <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>moſt powerful</hi> Cauſe, and is only aſſiſted and ſtrenghened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Acceſſion of the latter. And what other Reaſon can be aſſigned?</p>
            <p>It cannot be the <hi>Force and Evidence of Truth,</hi> as plainly appears, not only from the <hi>foregoing Proofs</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> but from the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Atheiſts themſelves.</hi> It is not becauſe the Notions of <hi>God, Immortality</hi> and <hi>a Future State</hi> ſhock the Underſtanding, and contradict the plain Principles of Reaſon, that they deny theſe Foundations of all <hi>Religion.</hi> Was the <hi>Being of God</hi> conſider'd only as an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to ſolve the Difficulties of <hi>Nature</hi> by, without thoſe troubleſome Conſequences of <hi>Duty, Sin</hi> and <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> would not ſcruple <hi>this Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Lucretius</hi> himſelf would eaſily grant the <hi>Soul</hi> to be <hi>immortal,</hi> to be <hi>ſeparated from the Body</hi> and <hi>reunited</hi> again,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52063:127"/>would you allow him that Concluſion, that neither <hi>ſeparate</hi> nor <hi>reunited</hi> it hath any <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Remembrance</hi> of what was done <hi>before the Separation. God</hi> ſhould alſo enjoy the <hi>Fulneſs of Perfection,</hi> he ſhould be clothed with all the <hi>magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Attributes</hi> that Man could conceive, ſo his whole Employment was the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of himſelf,</hi> and the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his own Glory,</hi> and he was not unneceſſarily troubled to take account of <hi>our Actions.</hi> This is the dreadful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that perverts Mens Reaſon, and makes them deny what they fear, when they are reſolved to run the hazard of it.</p>
            <p>The quieting and laying theſe <hi>Fears Lucretius</hi> confeſſes is the <hi>whole Deſign</hi> of his Philoſophy. Which is a farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what I have undertaken to maintain; as will appear from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remarks.</p>
            <p>For firſt <hi>this Philoſopher</hi> obſerves, and ſeems to wonder at it, that the <hi>Fears of Death</hi> were <hi>very general,</hi> and made <hi>ſtrong Impreſſions</hi> upon the Minds of Men.</p>

For, otherwiſe, why ſhould the <hi>Wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> themſelves for what they do? or, ſuppoſing a <hi>future State,</hi> why ſhould <hi>they</hi> expect to be <hi>puniſh'd</hi> in it? why ſhould they not rather conceive <hi>God</hi> to be of their <hi>Side,</hi> give him contrary Attributes, and make him <hi>puniſh the Righteous</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Wicked?</hi> or, if that be too harſh a Notion of the <hi>Deity,</hi> why do they not change the Natures of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> call <hi>Evil good</hi> and <hi>Good evil?</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is ſtill the ſame. If it be Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to live as they do, if they live <hi>moſt up to their Nature,</hi> and <hi>moſt agreeably to their Reaſon,</hi> what need they <hi>fear? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> will <hi>approve</hi> and be <hi>pleas'd with</hi> their Actions. Since
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52063:129"/>therefore theſe Opinions offer too great a Violence to their Reaſon to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them, it is plain that they muſt acknowledge not only that there is a <hi>Difference</hi> in <hi>Actions,</hi> but that <hi>theirs</hi> are <hi>evil;</hi> not only that <hi>ſome Actions</hi> deſerve <hi>Reward,</hi> and <hi>ſome Puniſhment,</hi> but that the <hi>latter</hi> is due to <hi>theirs,</hi> or elſe what reaſon is there for Fears? or why do not <hi>all Men</hi> fear a <hi>future State</hi> alike, the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> as well as the <hi>Wicked?</hi> Now, when Men are reſolv'd to commit what they know to be <hi>ill</hi> and <hi>puniſhable,</hi> there is no Refuge left but to contrive ſome means of <hi>Impunity,</hi> and eſcaping the Sentence threatned; and this they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by <hi>denying</hi> either the <hi>Judge</hi> or the <hi>Place of Puniſhment.</hi> And this is the <hi>true Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> For no Man ever deny'd a <hi>God</hi> that thought his Way and Courſe of Life acceptable to ſuch a Being; no Man ever queſtioned a <hi>future State</hi> that could poſſibly perſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if there was one, <hi>Happineſs</hi> would be his Portion in it.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:52063:129"/>
            <p>As then it is not a <hi>Zeal for Truth</hi> that makes Men <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> ſo neither is it a <hi>generous Undertaking</hi> to free the World from the <hi>Bondage of Religion.</hi> For they cannot but be convinc'd that it would be very much for the Advantage of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> and <hi>Mankind in general</hi> if <hi>all</hi> Men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the <hi>ſtrict Rules of Religion.</hi> What noble Ideas does ſuch a Speculation as this afford us? and how diſmal would the Proſpect be, if <hi>Atheiſm</hi> ſpread as faſt as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> did in the <hi>firſt Ages</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> But not to purſue this any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what <hi>Bondage</hi> or <hi>Slavery</hi> is there in <hi>Religion,</hi> and what <hi>Abridgment</hi> of our <hi>Liberty?</hi> Thoſe that bear the Yoke think it eaſie and pleaſant, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>future Reward,</hi> preferable before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> as much as a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>eaſie Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is to be preferred before <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>living Wild.</hi> Why then ſhould they who never felt the Burthen complain of the Weight of it? but there are ſome Pleaſures and Enjoyments that Cuſtom hath made them fond of, and rendred difficult to be left off, and therefore they are reſolved to enjoy them ſtill; which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52063:130"/>they cannot do fully and to the height, without ſome Damp and Regret till they have got rid of thoſe <hi>Fears</hi> of a <hi>future Puniſhment</hi> their <hi>own Conſciences</hi> and the <hi>general Faith of the World</hi> threaten them with: in order therefore to this End, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>little Objection</hi> or <hi>Suſpicion</hi> is improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an <hi>Argument</hi> againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> and, by the advantage of <hi>ſtrong Wiſhes</hi> and a <hi>gradual Decay</hi> of <hi>contrary Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> heightned into <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> till, what, at firſt, their Luſts ſuggeſted to them with a <hi>perhaps</hi> there <hi>may be no ſuch thing</hi> as <hi>God</hi> or a <hi>future State,</hi> is, at laſt, ripen'd into a <hi>bold Denial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, when they have once got this Maſtery over themſelves, then do they ſit free, and deſpiſe the reſt of the World in Fetters, and laugh at what others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore. Then do <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Boldneſs</hi> paſs for <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſure of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> is the <hi>Ground of Faith.</hi> For how exquiſite and tranſporting is the Pleaſure of a <hi>new Notion</hi> or <hi>Invention?</hi> and how are Men's Wits ſet upon the ſtretch to find out freſh Opinions, and dreſs up old ones in a different manner, to get the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52063:130"/>Character of Men that <hi>think out of the road? Men</hi> ſhall live like <hi>Beaſts</hi> in the <hi>State of Nature,</hi> and devour one another, <hi>couch in their Dens at night, and in the morning ſeek their Prey: Beaſts,</hi> on the contrary, ſhall be ſo <hi>rational</hi> as to erect Common-wealths and Governments, if it ſerve for a new Notion to eſtabliſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Author.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the <hi>expoſing</hi> and <hi>ridiculing common Opinions,</hi> eſpecially the deſpiſing what is very much reſpected and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red carries a peculiar Satisfaction in it; there being nothing that recommends any Notion or Reflexion, any ſtroak of Wit or Reaſon ſo much as the Boldneſs of it. From hence it comes to paſs that <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> are entertained with a greater Guſt than <hi>Private Calumny</hi> and <hi>Detraction;</hi> and the ſame Expreſſion is counted wittier when it ſtrikes at <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>King</hi> than when it is levell'd againſt a Herd of <hi>common Mortals:</hi> For, to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the greateſt Actions that have been done in the World, to laugh at the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt celebrated Schemes of Knowledge that have ever been laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52063:131"/>is thought to argue a Spirit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of greater Performances. And to deſpiſe and contemn what the reſt of Mankind ſtand in aw of, ſeems to ſhew ſuch a <hi>Superiority of Senſe</hi> or <hi>Courage</hi> as eaſily tempts Men to affect this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter without conſidering whether they are able to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Thus are Men confirm'd and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Atheiſm</hi> by the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> of appearing <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>wiſer</hi> than <hi>others,</hi> and being thought Maſters of <hi>finer</hi> and <hi>more extraordinary Talents</hi> either of <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Reflexion:</hi> as is plain alſo from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance, in which Men ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve to be very much influenced by theſe Motives in matters of Religion; and that is, a groundleſs unreaſonable <hi>Diffidence</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of being put or impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; calling every thing <hi>Trick</hi> or <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> that they do not underſtand, or any body elſe gets an Advantage by. For, by this means, they imagin they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh to themſelves a Reputation of great <hi>Sagacity</hi> and <hi>Reach,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing far into matters;</hi> whereas, in reality, this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Cunning of theirs only betrays the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52063:131"/>Weakneſs of their Judgments, and ſhews them to be of the ſame ſize of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with thoſe fooliſh Politicians, who find a thouſand Myſteries in State-Affairs more than the Managers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ever knew of, and think every the moſt natural and undeſigning Action of a Prince to be the effect of ſome ſecret Counſel and Contrivance.</p>
            <p>Now, that theſe beforementioned are the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> and that the Belief and Patronage of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> of <hi>Irreligion</hi> is the <hi>ſole Reſult</hi> of <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and not <hi>deliberate Reaſon,</hi> will further appear from the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe who go under the Name of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> or <hi>Deiſts,</hi> whether <hi>real, pretended</hi> or <hi>reputed,</hi> are generally Perſons of <hi>no great Reach</hi> or <hi>Capacity,</hi> Men of ſtrong Luſts, and irregular Imaginations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Ballaſt of Reaſon; impatient of Thinking and Attention, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, unable to examine any Variety of Pretences, or to diſtinguiſh betwixt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52063:132"/>Colour and Argument. Thoſe of them who are furniſh'd with a better ſtock of <hi>natural Senſe,</hi> have it wholly <hi>unimproved</hi> and <hi>uncultivated;</hi> or, if they have made any Advances in Knowledge by Study or Induſtry, they have either <hi>begun late,</hi> and ſo fell into the middle of Learning without the Aſſiſtance of the firſt grounds and Rudiments, and applied themſelves to ſuch Books they light upon, or which happened to be recommended to them, without due Choice and Direction; or elſe they have been chiefly converſant in <hi>ſuch Studies</hi> as have by no means quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to be <hi>Judges out of their own Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a Man may be very well vers'd in <hi>Hiſtory, Antiquities,</hi> or <hi>Experimental Knowledge;</hi> he may be a great Maſter of <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> and a nice Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the <hi>true Meaning</hi> or <hi>Reading</hi> of an <hi>antient Author;</hi> he may have a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Elegance of Expreſſion,</hi> and have Skill enough to diſcover the <hi>Beauties</hi> and <hi>Faults</hi> of the <hi>moſt celebrated Models</hi> of Writing: and yet, after all, in matters of <hi>general</hi> and <hi>abſtracted Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52063:132"/>not be able to underſtand a <hi>plain, eaſie Conſequence.</hi> For, 'tis not difficult to obſerve how ridiculouſly oftentimes Men of known Abilities in ſome of theſe or the like reſpects, argue and infer; and how incapable they are of making or perceiving a juſt Deduction, in points of <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>civil</hi> Knowledge, and ſuch in which the <hi>Conduct of Life</hi> and <hi>Happineſs of Mankind</hi> is immediately concerned: whereas, on the contrary, thoſe who are acquainted with the <hi>general Rules</hi> and <hi>Laws of Reaſoning,</hi> and the <hi>different kinds</hi> and <hi>manners of Proof</hi> are capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king true Judgments and Inferences in <hi>any Subject</hi> they have been ever ſo little converſant in, upon a <hi>bare explication of the Terms,</hi> and <hi>juſt relation of Facts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Matter to be judg'd of. Now, this is a piece of <hi>Knowledge</hi> that I may venture to ſay, the <hi>Favourers of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi> have been always the greateſt Strangers to; and the leſs any of them have been acquainted with this kind of Learning, the leſs they have employed and exerciſed their rational Faculties, and ſtill the leſs common natural Senſe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52063:133"/>they have been born with, the ſtronger, more confident, and more unſcrupulous Atheiſts have they been.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, as we are ſatisfied, from the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Capacities</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi> that they are wholly determined to their Opinions by <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>falſe unequal Motives of Judging;</hi> ſo are we further confirmed in this Perſuaſion by the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Proceſs</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi> For they commonly <hi>believe firſt</hi> before they enter upon any <hi>Examination</hi> or <hi>Proof</hi> of their <hi>Principles.</hi> What they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the matter, all the Arguments or Objections they are furniſh'd with are found out afterwards, not to ſatisfie and convince themſelves, but to make a ſhew of Defence againſt the Charge of others; they take up their Opinions haſtily and of a ſuddain; they do not proceed by Degrees, by cautious and wary Steps, weighing and ballancing the Arguments on both ſides, ſometimes inclining to the one and ſometimes to the other, calling in the Advice and Reaſon of other Men to their aſſiſtance, and all along ſhewing a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52063:133"/>Concern and Fear of being miſtaken, ſuitable to the Importance of the thing to be judged of. Thus do Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly behave themſelves in a Change from <hi>one Sect of Religion to another,</hi> if they ſincerely aim at Truth, and are not governed by any other falſe Motive. But who ever heard of a Man who took this method of turning <hi>Atheiſt?</hi> Which of them all can ſay he conſider'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Proofs of both Opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left one and took up the other? When was any body called in to plead in the behalf of <hi>Religion,</hi> before it was caſt off, and to ſettle the firſt Miſtruſts and Waverings of an <hi>Atheiſtical Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Afterwards</hi> perhaps, upon ſome Checks and Reluctance of his Mind, an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> may have had ſome faint Deſigns of examining into the Truth of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and may have diſcours'd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about it; but then a long cuſtom of thinking and talking one way, and the troubleſome Conſequences attending a Change of Faith, may have indiſpoſed him to entertain or reliſh the Arguments for <hi>Religion,</hi> not to mention any thing of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52063:134"/>a <hi>judicial Blindneſs</hi> inflicted upon him from <hi>God,</hi> for his long unreaſonable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>Truth.</hi> But, if an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will examine fairly into the <hi>firſt Riſe</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> he will find it was a <hi>haſty Effort</hi> occaſioned by <hi>high Blood</hi> and a <hi>rais'd Imagination,</hi> or ſome <hi>bold Strain of Wit,</hi> that ſtruck him when he was rightly diſpoſed to be pleaſed with it. And, if we ſhould examine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe things more particularly, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it would appear that <hi>all irreligious Opinions</hi> are <hi>firſt</hi> taken up <hi>in Company,</hi> and that no Man receives the <hi>firſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm alone</hi> from his <hi>own calm</hi> and <hi>ſedate Reflexions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, as <hi>Irreligion ſprings</hi> from <hi>Prejudice,</hi> ſo is it <hi>nouriſhed</hi> and <hi>fed</hi> the <hi>ſame way;</hi> by a conſtant Application to ſuch Books and Company as give it any countenance or colour of Defence; with an induſtrious avoiding and ridiculing the contrary; picking out ſuch things as miniſter moſt occaſion for Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and magnifying every bold thing that is ſaid by any Man, without any regard to his other Opinions, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52063:134"/>even of that that is liked; 'tis no matter whether it really proves any thing againſt Religion or no, ſo it is thought by the <hi>Profeſſors of Religion</hi> to bear hard either upon the <hi>fundamental Principles,</hi> or <hi>any remote accceſſional Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> owned by them.</p>
            <p>From whence it comes to paſs that the <hi>preſent Atheiſm</hi> is a <hi>promiſcuous Miſcellany</hi> of <hi>all the bold notions</hi> that have <hi>ever</hi> been vented by thoſe they ſtile Free-thinkers: where, whatever ſeems to be levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Point of Religion is embraced as the moſt ſenſible and rational account that can be given of the thing; but thoſe Parts of Religion which are eſtabliſhed by the ſame Authors are ſlighted and paſt over as weakly done; whereas I will be bound to prove that there is never an <hi>Article</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> profeſs'd by us, but is own'd and maintain'd by ſome or other of theſe bold <hi>Free-thinking Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> which are ſo highly approved and commended by the <hi>preſent Atheiſts.</hi> And what a groſs Partiality is this, not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe whom they cry up for <hi>unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd</hi> Men to talk a Word of Senſe or
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52063:135"/>Reaſon, but when what they ſay makes for their Purpoſe?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But Thirdly, we have a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Proof that the <hi>Doctrines of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> are the <hi>genuine Iſſue</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> before aſſigned, from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Atheiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; who, upon juſt Convictions of Conſcience, having diſclaimed their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> have freely and ſincerely owned that they threw off <hi>Religion</hi> without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver examining or conſidering the Proofs of it; that they were diſpoſed and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to entertain irreligious Notions by the <hi>Power</hi> and Influence of their <hi>Luſts,</hi> or ſuch vicious Habits and Cuſtoms of living as they thought irreconcilable with a contrary Belief; that the Reaſons why they endeavoured to perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of what their Courſe of Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them to believe were, to defend thoſe Liberties of Practice they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cenſures of others, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their own Minds in an eaſie undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd Enjoyment of them; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the firſt and ſtrongeſt Impreſſions
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52063:135"/>of Unbelief were occaſioned by ſome bold Hints and Inſinuations, or ſome witty Ridicule or Raillery upon the Subject of <hi>Religion;</hi> that, as theſe either in Books or Diſcourſe, coming from others, gave them very great Pleaſure, and by that means Aſſurance, in embracing theſe new Principles, ſo were they further pleaſed and confirm'd together in their Belief of them, by applauded Trials and Exerciſe of their own Wit the ſame way; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the general <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of the Perſons they convers'd with, made this Entertainment very agreeable and very frequent. All this have ſeveral Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, upon their <hi>Repentance,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd.</p>
            <p>And that which ſtrengthens the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from hence, is, that thoſe who have renounced their <hi>Irreligious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and given this account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have been, ſome of them, Men of the <hi>beſt natural Abilities,</hi> and <hi>greateſt acquired Improvements,</hi> of any that ever took the Party of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> has been <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> and not extorted by any frightful Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52063:136"/>or importunate Addreſſes, in the ſeaſons of Fear and Weakneſs; it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun from themſelves, and been wholly owing to the over-ruling Impreſſions of a <hi>Divine Power</hi> and not to <hi>Human Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and their Blindneſs and Prejudices being, by this means, removed, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for <hi>Religion</hi> have prevailed upon them by their own Strength, as ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by their own Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any Advantage from the Management and Art of others.</p>
            <p>And this I think ſufficient to ſhew that <hi>Atheiſm</hi> proceeds from <hi>ſtrong Prejudices</hi> and <hi>falſe, diſproportioned Motions of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and is not the reſult of <hi>juſt Reaſoning</hi> and <hi>impartial Reflexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now gone through the ſeveral Branches of my Diſcourſe, I propoſed to my ſelf in the beginning of it; and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Proof I undertook of <hi>general</hi> or, as 'tis commonly called, <hi>natural</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>All that I have further to add upon this Subject, at preſent, is, to give ſome
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52063:136"/>account of the Notions of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Deiſm;</hi> which Words I have been forced to uſe ſometimes promiſcuouſly, and in a different Senſe from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation, for want of a fit and proper Word to expreſs a <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of <hi>any ſuch Opinions</hi> which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>practical Influence</hi> and <hi>Power of Religion.</hi> For which reaſon I think it convenient in this place, that I may reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy any Confuſion or Miſtake, the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I have taken in the uſe of theſe Terms may have occaſioned, to ſet down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly what I look upon to be the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Deiſm,</hi> and what <hi>Ideas I ſhould chuſe</hi> to affix <hi>theſe Words to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is <hi>commonly</hi> meant ſuch a one as will own <hi>no Being</hi> under the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And he who does acknowledge ſuch a Being, let his Conceptions of him be what they will, is <hi>no Atheiſt.</hi> And, in <hi>this Senſe</hi> of the Word, it may well be made a queſtion, Whether there be any ſuch thing as an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the World? For, 'tis hard to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52063:137"/>find a Man who has not <hi>ſome Idea</hi> in his Mind, which he will allow the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to: tho, upon Examination, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will be found to be nothing elſe but a confuſed Notion of <hi>ſome vast Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Firſt Cauſe, Original Mover,</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Being, enjoying Eternal Reſt and Quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, according to this Notion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> he who profeſſes to <hi>believe a God,</hi> whatever <hi>Nature, Characters</hi> and <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> he aſcribes to him, and <hi>Denies</hi> his <hi>Providence</hi> or <hi>Government of Mankind</hi> is called a <hi>Deiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, in ſuch places where the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Revelation</hi> are acknowledged and defended, he that is called a <hi>Deiſt</hi> is one that owns a <hi>God,</hi> and believes <hi>ſome ſort</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>natural Obligations,</hi> but denies <hi>all manner of Revelation;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines his <hi>Duty</hi> to matters of <hi>Civil Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Commerce;</hi> makes theſe his chief <hi>Principles, not to injure another,</hi> and to <hi>keep his Word;</hi> grounds his Practice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Intereſt of Societies,</hi> and his <hi>own preſent Advantage,</hi> not <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God,</hi> or a <hi>future Proſpect;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52063:137"/>
               <hi>no future Life,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>ſuch a one</hi> as can have no great Influence upon a Mans Actions here. This is the <hi>common general Uſe</hi> of theſe Words.</p>
            <p>But, by an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> I think, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and juſtly be meant, not only he that <hi>abſolutely denies</hi> the <hi>Being of a God,</hi> but whoſoever ſays <hi>there is no God that governs the World, and judgeth the Earth;</hi> there is <hi>no God that has appointed Laws and Rules for Men to act by;</hi> there is <hi>no God to whom Men are accountable for all their Actions,</hi> and <hi>by whom they ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or puniſhed in a future State according to their Behaviour here;</hi> and, in general, whoever holds ſuch an Opinion which <hi>exempts him from all Obligation of Duty to a Superiour Being,</hi> or <hi>cuts off the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rewards and Puniſhments</hi> conſequent thereupon.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is to be conſidered as a <hi>Vice</hi> and not a <hi>meer Error in Speculation.</hi> And therefore, he that denies <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Natural Law,</hi> or a <hi>Future State,</hi> is as much an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> as he that denies <hi>God's Being:</hi> For, it's all one, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52063:138"/>to Practice, to ſay <hi>there is no God,</hi> as to ſay <hi>there's no Obedience due to him,</hi> or <hi>no Puniſhment for Diſobedience, if there be:</hi> it is likewiſe all one to deny <hi>divine Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment directly,</hi> and to deny the <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul,</hi> or the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in the Senſe of thoſe who at preſent deny theſe things: For they who ſay the <hi>Soul dies with the Body,</hi> think hereby to prove that <hi>God cannot puniſh;</hi> and they who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Scriptures</hi> do it in order to ſhew that he <hi>will not puniſh,</hi> that is, <hi>in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life;</hi> and, as to the <hi>preſent,</hi> they perceive that thoſe who are ſtiled <hi>Wicked</hi> fare as well, and have as large a Portion of the good things of this World as their <hi>Righteous Brethren.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> then <hi>of all theſe Opinions</hi> is the <hi>ſame;</hi> namely, to eſtabliſh <hi>a Liberty for every Man to live as he pleaſes,</hi> and <hi>to do whatſoever is right in his own Eyes;</hi> and what is this but to ſay, <hi>there is no God in Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Notion I have of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt;</hi> and accordingly I have applied the word <hi>indifferently,</hi> as I had occaſion, to <hi>any Perſons</hi> that denied <hi>any of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:52063:138"/>of <hi>Religion</hi> I have endeavour'd to eſtabliſh: And I have uſed the word <hi>Deiſt</hi> in the ſame Senſe with that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi> every where but where I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concern'd in the Proof of <hi>God's Being,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>other Parts of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here, in oppoſition to the Character I have now given of an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> by a <hi>Deiſt</hi> is to be meant ſuch a one who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>all the Principles of Religion here maintained;</hi> who thinks he is obliged to inform himſelf truly of his whole Duty to God, and to live up to the higheſt and pureſt Rules of <hi>Morality</hi> he can form to himſelf, by the Aſſiſtance of his own Reaſon, and the united Lights of other Men; who looks upon all the <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>practical</hi> Part of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as very uſeful and inſtructive, and conſequently to be read and valued as <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> are, upon the ſame Subject: but does not believe any ſuch thing as <hi>Revelation,</hi> or aſſent to any of thoſe <hi>peculiar matters of Fact,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> which are wholly grounded upon <hi>that extraordinary way of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52063:139"/>Conveyance,</hi> and are not <hi>level to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> or <hi>diſcoverable by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if a <hi>Deiſt</hi> be ſuch as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, it would be as juſt a matter of Enquiry whether there be any Perſons to whom this Title belongs, as whether there be any real <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the World. For my part, I will not poſitively ſay there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>true Deist,</hi> in that ſenſe I have given of the word, becauſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there hardly was any Opinion known among Men, that ſome body was not of; but this, I think, I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, that it would be the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culteſt thing imaginable to find a Man in a <hi>Chriſtian Countrey,</hi> who was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Books of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>common Proofs</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> who was fully perſuaded of the Truth of <hi>all the Principles</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion here laid down,</hi> and ſeriouſly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conform his Life according to the <hi>Moral Rules</hi> and <hi>Precepts of the Goſpel,</hi> and yet denied <hi>Revelation,</hi> and all thoſe particular Truths which ſtand diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Name of <hi>Revealed Religion:</hi> ſuch a Man as this, I believe, is hard to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52063:139"/>be met with. For it is not <hi>Propheſies</hi> or <hi>Miracles</hi> or <hi>Myſteries</hi> that puzzle the <hi>Faith</hi> of thoſe that now go under the Name of <hi>Deiſts;</hi> but a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>full Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> of a <hi>future State</hi> of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> This is the ſhocking repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Doctrine, in compariſon of which the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi> are eaſie No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and very reconcileable to their Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Upon this account it is, that I have ſeveral times mentioned <hi>Deiſts</hi> as <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> and ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coming within my Subject, and not as <hi>meer Oppoſers</hi> of <hi>Revelation,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another Argument.</p>
            <p>And now, having pointed out who they are that are particularly concerned in the foregoing Diſcourſe, it might be expected that I ſhould addreſs my ſelf to them to embrace thoſe Principles of Religion I have there proved, and to beſtow ſome ſerious Thoughts about the Danger of their Unbelief; but I am too well acquainted with their Character to trouble them with any
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52063:140"/>Advice of this nature: If they are not convinced and bore down by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, I am ſure they will never yield to <hi>Perſuaſion;</hi> neither indeed is it proper to go about to perſuade Men to <hi>believe;</hi> they only are to be applied to in this manner, who are ſatisfied of the Truth of what you would perſuade them to, but want ſufficient Motives and Incitements to <hi>practiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore ſhut up this whole Diſcourſe with my earneſt Prayers to God, that he would be pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and diſpoſe thoſe who are doubtful and wavering in the Concerning Points of Religion, to weigh and conſider well the Proofs it ſtands upon, before they venture to withdraw themſelves from under the Influence and Government of it; that he would defend the Innocent, and ſuch as are unacquainted with the Ways of Irreligion, from the falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and Inſinuations of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; that he would convince the Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Indifferent of the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of having ſome Religion; and that he would be further pleaſed to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52063:140"/>enable thoſe that are already convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of this Truth to ſtop the mouths of Gain-ſayers, by a ſteady and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Practice of their Duty every way anſwerable to their Knowledge and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
